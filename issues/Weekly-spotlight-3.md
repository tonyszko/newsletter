# Friday's spotlight #3

## Future of tech and drones, Open Source, Silicon, VR and more



---



Howdy, 

It is a week where you got a lot of e-mails from me. I hope you found my  previous e-mail interesting (if you haven't read it, you can still  search for it in your Inbox). 

Yet, now it is a time for Friday's dose of inspiration, links, knowledge, and whatever Internet brought to my mind this week. 

This week, I cover the future, some interesting technology links, and  trends. That was also a busy week for me in the digital realm, and you  will find few links at the end. 

Without further ado, let's dive in. 

​                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)                                                                                            

## ﻿**### Future spotlight** 

I am often asked what will be the future technology and what one should  invest its time. I DON'T KNOW. However ... there are some indicators. 

What is more important, I see more future around developing the practices  around technology and how to use it for a solution of a problem than the technology itself. I'm a huge fan and aspiring practitioner of  something called Wardley Maps. The author and creator Simon Wardley  often pushes on his Twitter accounts fascinating threads on trends and  directions. Last week what caught my eye was this tweet:

 ﻿﻿*"X : What are the major technology impacts in the future ... AI? Bitcoin? Cloud? Digital Transformation?"*

​                      [             ![Screen from Twitter](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/b200ff7364153a3e60e16fbf3823d91a7c08b652.png/83b45576eee0881c1c6d6d2a1263fdafe89188a4.png)           ](https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1371496868912504837)

What follows is a list of **forty-one (41**) possible trends and practices in society, technology, and it that might develop and impact our future. 

If anything, those "trends" will shape our work and environment for the  years to come. Some of them will create new occupations, some of them  will need new technology to be developed. It is a list worth reading and thinking about those trends: what it can mean for me, you, society,  technology, and the environment. 

A practical example of using maps to look at future states - look at this.

## ﻿**### Technology spotlight**

﻿**How Open is Open Source project?**

One thing which comes with the cloud is Open Source. Believe it or not,  companies still don't know how to work with Open Source. There is no  surprise in it. It is easy for us to start to use some OSS project and  then drop it. For company - not that easy. When it becomes a part of a  product or application, you need to maintain it somehow. 

Here is a resource you might find helpful - [A Framework for Open Source Evaluation](https://monetize.substack.com/p/a-framework-for-open-source-evaluation), not only in your work but also in your projects. As the author wrote in the introduction - *(...) The question is no longer if a project is open-source or not; the question is how much open a project is. (...)*. Not all Open Source is equal. 

﻿**Security ... and security again!** 

This moment had to come - time to write about security and MFA. Do you think you need specific skills to hack someone's phone and take over all text messages? Nope, sometimes all you need is $16. Yes, sixteen dollars.  Read this story first - [A Hacker Got All My Texts for $16](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g8wb/hacker-got-my-texts-16-dollars-sakari-netnumber) and then go and get one of Security Keys (I use Yubikey's, but all of them are good.)

Why security key? It is like a physical key to your doors but better. If a  website wants to use it, it needs to prove that it is a valid website,  plus someone can't use your key without a physical presence next to it.  Phishing is a huge problem now. With security key problem of phishing is gone. 

Get one (or better two), use it with your Twitter, Gmail, Facebook, GitHub, Office 365, 1Password - you name it. If you don't know how to start,  let me know that I will put short "how-to" on-line if there is a need. 

﻿**Silicon** 

In my[ first podcast episode, I spoke about Silicon Wars](https://link.chtbl.com/RViIUSnz) ([https://link.chtbl.com/RViIUSn...](https://link.chtbl.com/RViIUSnz)). If you have not listened to it, its points in short 

- Silicon chips are becoming more and more important 
- Only a few countries have the capabilities to build it on their own (spoiler: Europe as a region is not one of them)
- The ability to design and produce chips will become crucial in the future.

This week I listened to episode #162 of Lex Fridman's show with Jim Keller ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Keller_)(engineer), a microprocessor engineer. I found it fascinating and informative about the design, challenges, and future of silicon chips. Here it is for you - Jim Keller: [The Future of Computing, AI, Life, and Consciousness | Lex Fridman Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4hL5Om4IJ4)

﻿﻿**NFTs, not all that shines is gold and VR.**

Hard not to hear about NFTs those days (I know, I wrote about it before).  Bear with me on this topic last time for at least a few weeks (promise). 

New technology is always challenging, not only from a technical point of  view but value delivered. Here is a good thread where someone looked  into what people are buying with all those $$$ as NFTs. Surprise,  surprise. It might not be that bullet and value proof, and if the  company who sold it will go bust, then the [good represented by NFT might disappear as well](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122). Learning - make sure you understand a thing before you put your money into it. 

Some time ago, I wrote on my blog about VR (I mentioned this last Friday). I see coming about VR is fulfilling a need of people to be different in  the virtual world. I wrote about custom avatars' future business (if you have graphics skills, think about it). Still, VR apartments' design  might also be a hot thing - [Creator who sold NFT house for $500,000: We'll be 'living in an augmented reality lifestyle' soon](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/creator-of-first-nft-digital-house-krista-kim-on-augmented-reality-.html). 

Virtual worlds might be closer than you and I, and virtual spaces design might  be future occupations. Facebook is pushing VR game hard - [recently with an interface to better track hands movement and get rid of controllers](https://tech.fb.com/inside-facebook-reality-labs-wrist-based-interaction-for-the-next-computing-platform/). Pretty amazing what they did.

We need someone else than Facebook to step hard into this space! VR deserves better than Facebook.

## ﻿**### Digital me**

Again, this was a busy week in the digital realm. Some people ask me why so  many things are happening and how I find a time for it. Remember - what  is happening today often was planned weeks. You see a result, and some  effects accumulate in time. 

Here's a list of my posts, podcast episodes, and other activities from last week. 

New blog post - **[Five ultimate productivity tips!](https://www.onyszko.com/five-ultimate-productivity-tips/)** A title is clickbait'ish, but the genesis of this post is interesting. I use those techniques for a long time, and I shared them on Twitter in  one thread. To my surprise, 12+k people react, like, responded. I was  surprised it isn't something everybody does, so here it is. Try it. 

New podcast episode (Polish language) - about strategy with strategy consultant **[Krzysiek Daniel](https://www.kda.zone/)**. Krzysiek is a fascinating person who works with many companies in the  interesting field of strategy. This time we talked about strategy in a  personal career context, people, books, and more. 

I was a guest in Friday Dose, a series of live events hosted by Pawel  Maczka. Again, it is Polish, but if you want to look here, it is on YT - [#FridayDose 11: Predict the Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzyi39ClbSU).

​                      [             ![Friday Dose: Predict the future](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/046c36260d11134066736252ad830f3215a62224.png/64715b6bcd1b6c20d63fd2139a4719c7d20f4395.png)           ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzyi39ClbSU)                    

Story of Predica, cloud, our strategy, future of tech and cloud, where to  look for future work, strategy, delivering user value, and many more.  Long and packed conversation.

​                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)                                                                                            

That's all, folks. As usual, this is a limited selection of things from me to  you! If you found it intriguing - GREAT! If you want to tweak it a bit - the best way is to reply to this e-mail and let me know how you find  it. There is no better way to improve something than by giving feedback. 

Enjoy your weekend!
