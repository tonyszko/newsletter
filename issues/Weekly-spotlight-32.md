## Choosing the future - where we are and my take. DIDs,  cloud native stack, chaos tools for cloud ... and more

---



Hi 

What can you do on a lovely Saturday, being stuck at home (quarantined)? 

As every person in IT, I did what each of us does from time to time,  striving for perfection - I've decided to clean the mess of cables  around my desk. Happy with the result, but still, it isn't something I'm ready to post in public. You all know what I mean :). 

After fixing my cables, I went for a long run (stay fit, clear your mind - it helps in the long haul) and listened to the podcast. This one made me  think, and I've decided to dump my thoughts around it in this e-mail and share it with you. 

Be warned - it is a long one, so if you don't have time now, you may jump  directly to the links section, skim it, and get back to this one later. 

## Choosing the future 

Here is a piece of media I listened to during my weekend run. I've decided to include it as a central theme for this e-mail - [Tim Ferris podcast episode](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) with **[Balaji S. Srinivasan](**[**https://twitter.com/balajis**](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)). 

​                      [ ![Balaji Srinivasan on Bitcoin, The Great Awokening, Wolf Warrior Diplomacy, Open-Source Ecology, Reputational Civil War, Creating New Cities, and Options for Becoming a Sane but Sovereign Individual (#547)](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/65114574a9cf1ed2230f5c56a46a5dabd4ebfda8.png) ](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)                    

I've mentioned Balaji a few times before in this newsletter. Even if you are not pro-crypto or not following this space, it is worth listening and  following Balaji and his ideas. He is posting a lot of fresh or  provocative thinking around technology, society, and geopolitics. 

In my case, I agree in many cases with his point of view around the  potential development of technology and society. Still, I can't entirely agree with him about the judgment of this change will be positive for  our society or not. 

That's me; you need to make your judgment (or not and ignore this altogether, that's the beauty of the choices).

I haven't finished listening to it yet, I left a bit for today's 8KM rest run, but I've decided to include it here because of the content of its  first half (or so). It focuses on the direction of the world and what  part technology will play in it. 

Few key points in this area I've picked to set the context for this e-mail before you listen to it (or not):

- We are witnessing the collapse of the  institution of the government (remember that they speak in the context  of the US, but it is visible all around us as well). 
- The future will be decided between more centralized and decentralized models of countries and economies.
- The current movement in technology towards  tokenization (what a word) of things will lead to the global market,  where everything will be priced towards everything else. 
- It will shift the balance of power between  employees and those who employers and approach work in general (more  towards the employers). 
- It will shift the balance from central to more  local decision-making at gov and community level (again, they speak in  the context of the US as a country).

There is plenty of side threads, but those are the points I want to focus on a bit today. 

### Why I've decided to write about it? 

I have similar conclusions as expressed in this conversation on my own  about the direction. Not sure (no crystal ball here) about the timeline  or actual events which will happen. We are heading towards disruptive  times with changing balances in technology and geopolitics. In the end,  it will shape the new order of things. New order in many areas:

- Technology
- Society
- Economy 
- Geopolitics and local politics. 

The more I look at this list, the more I see those things being tightly  connected with these connections even stronger in the future. In a mid  to few years term, I think these movements will also shape many things  around us, with direct influence on things like things we do and use  every day or how and where do we work? 

The most significant change might come with wider adoption of what we  generally call right now "crypto." Why? Because that will be a paradigm  shift affecting a lot of current models and institutions. Note that  saying "*affecting* "doesn't tell if it will be a positive or negative effect. 

When paradigm shifts, then a lot of things change around us in quick and  dramatic ways. It is vital to understand that none of us has a model of  what might happen or how to react when it happens. 

Why? 

Because those changes happen in a time frame longer than the human lifespan,  think about it. Such change happened before after the World Wars period  (in general between 1900 and 1945). Still, people who remember it are  now gone or very old. Before World Wars, the world looks different. The  UK ruled the world as an Empire, and people used the British pound to  speak about the value. 

After World Wars, the world shifted to be the one affected by the United  States the most. It is the world we live in, and most of us grew up  in—relatively peaceful and stable. People lived their entire lives doing pretty much what they thought they would be doing when they were kids. 

Because such changes happen very rarely, we don't have a frame of reference to  spot it and judge what direction it might take. We have. Those are books and history lessons, but we are not very good at digging into those as a general population. 

### Central vs distributed 

The significant focus of the conversation in this podcast is about  "central" vs. "distributed" and not only in the context of the economy  or money but also in government. I think it will be an essential topic  for many of us as a choice in years to come. 

Some of you wrote to me, why I'm pro-China or mention China that much? I'm  not pro-China, but it is one of the signs of these two models taking  different routes at the moment. 

To set things clear:

- I'm aware of the China government and problems  with its approach to my limited knowledge based on books, videos, and  articles I read about them.
- By any means, I'm not an expert in this area and do not aspire to be one.

I find China interesting (with my minimal knowledge) because they are  going a different route. China as a country witnessed the rise and fall  of the Soviet Union and is seeing the long-term effect of the western  culture and approach in the other part of the world. The difference is  that apparently, they learn from it. 

Balaji, in this podcast, explains the different models China and "The West" use to build and promote their cadres to rule the world. In a nutshell -  China promotes a bottom-up model and carving your way up in a hierarchy, where "The West" is mainly based on the inheritance of wealth and  power. That creates a different quality of people, resulting in  different outcomes for people, society, and the economy. 

Where does it connect for you? 

Suppose the Central vs. Distributed model of the countries will happen. What  would be your preference - to live in a more "centralized" country with  more things controlled by government or to be part of one of many  "distributed" nodes of society? 

If it comes to long-term success, do you think the balance will be more on the "Centralized" approach where they coordinate their entire policy  and strategy or on "distributes" countries, where each part has a saying and can decide its policy and direction? 

My take on it.  I think that short term, more decentralized approach to  countries and society will produce better results for selected  individuals and groups. In a long time, the country that will act and  coordinate centrally will be in a better position for its society. 

"Centralized" doesn't mean the China model with a single ruling party but a society  that understands the power coming from acting together for a long  period. It is always a long-haul game. 

For you, it might be a choice of where do you want to live now and maybe in the future, where one or another model will start to prevail in the  world or your local geography. It doesn't have to be drastic like moving to China. Still, for example, for people living in Poland, it might be  appealing to move to smaller countries like Estonia or Switzerland. 

### Who will be left behind?

That's a great question which is mostly not been answered so far. If  "decentralization" happens, who will be left behind? In the part of this podcast where the discussion goes into "everything as an order book"  and how companies will be able to compensate the local workforce with  automation or compensate it with an economy based on "tokens" (as a  concept), there is no answer about who will be left behind. 

Have you seen the movie ["*Elysium*"](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)? That's the one version of a future, where everything is an order book  and some people were left behind. Would you like to live in it? 

There will be people left behind, and there will be a cost of dealing with  it. The difference will be how the given society will deal with it. And  technology will not solve this problem as it has not solved the problem  so far (regardless of what is being said by tech people). 

What will be your preference? Live in a place that focuses on making it more equal to not leave the majority behind or the one who focuses on the  top performers and let the rest deal with it at their own pace? 

### What to do with all of it? 

OK - so after this lengthy write-up, what should you do with all of it? 

Do you need to panic right now? Most likely not. It will take years, if  not decades; however, some events might happen pretty fast. It also will depend a lot on the effect of climate change around us, as it may  accelerate the events in many areas. 

For me, it comes down to a couple of choices or actions I will do in the following months/years:

- I've will actively track and educate myself on  new technology trends around Web3. I'm doing it all the time, but right  now, it will be a deliberate effort to understand this space a bit  deeper. It doesn't mean becoming the crypto trader but more digging  deeper into selected areas of it. 
- I will try to build an answer to the question,  "If not Poland" then what?" There are no plans to change my location in  the next couple of years unless something dramatic happens. Still, I  want to orient myself to what other countries or places are viable  alternatives. 
- When allocating my time and capital, I will  prefer to work on options that are not tight to specific geography or  location. If the company then distributed from the start. If my  activity, then focused on online training. You get the trend ... 

In all of it, I will focus on things I can control. It is about allocating my time and focus, filtering what I see, read and do with it. It is  always a personal struggle to narrow down the focus and actions against  going too broad on the topic. 

Nothing drastic and no specific goals (more I think about it, less I'm a fan of particular goals, maybe I will cover it next week), but you can sense a general direction of it. Those are also not decisions made under the  influence of this single podcast, but I've started doing it some time  ago. This e-mail was an opportunity to write about it and share it with  you. 

In the end, it all might (and most likely will) turn out as opposed to  what was predicted. There is no point in worrying about the future.  However, it doesn't mean that you might not try to anticipate possible  changes and **still focus on what you can control** as a question "**What if**?" in a constructive way. 

What is your approach here? 

That was a long one; if you are still with me (I hope), let's go for the  weekly portion of links, tools, and books I gathered this week for you. 

​                                                                                                                                          



## Bookmarks spotlight 

### We need more cockroaches in business!

The previous week I've mentioned a book, ["The Minimalist Entrepreneur: How Great Founders Do More with Less"](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) from Sahil Lavinia. This week I saw this article - ["Forget unicorns, here;s why cockroaches matter."](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)

​                      [ ![Unicorns vs Cockroaches model](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/3d5f02df08711e7399542997824bd57471d8d965.png) ](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)                    

If I build something from scratch again, it will be more a cockroach than a unicorn. Cockroach, for me, is a company model with a focus on solving a problem and delivering the value/outcome while not looking only to grow and get external money from valuations. 

It is about building a long-term sustainable business with its user base  and product. Unicorn valuations are nice and will make you rich, but  maybe cockroach with your limited involvement. Providing steady and  profitable business is a much better option. 

Look for cockroaches, as those might also be better places to work and develop your career.



### Who pays for credit card transactions, and who has enough of it? 

If you haven't thought about it, there is always a price tag behind the  convenience of using a credit card (always follow the money if in  doubt). You don't see it directly as it is hidden in the price of goods  and covered by merchants. If all people would drop credit cards use, we  could expect a drop in the prices (or not) as now it needs to include  it. 

Apparently, Amazon has enough of it and practices of companies like Visa and  decided to take action. You will not be able to pay with Credit Card in  the UK with Amazon starting 2022 - ["Visa Tumbles on Amazon Ban in the UK as Fight on Card Fees Expands."](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)

I've decided to include this one if my cards are not from the UK and I don't shop there too often? 

It is one of the signals, which might tip companies like Amazon to abandon the current system if they are fed up with it and make their move. What kind of move? 

Maybe introduce their stable coin to settle the transactions on the platform  or step into the financial system game and become the "Visa." It won't  happen overnight, but those are signals (or noise) worth observing.



### Will DIDs fix the web? 

That's a good question? As you can judge by the recent e-mails, regardless of  my opinions on the outcome of crypto technology, I try to read, educate  myself and make my own judgment. 

One of the areas I'm betting it might impact is not precisely the  crypto-technology itself but Distributed Identity space with Verifiable  credentials. Here is a good entry material - ["How Decentralized Identifiers And Bitcoin Fix The Web."](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) My objection to the title and article is that the entire concept  doesn't need Bitcoin for it. Technically it might be any accepted and  trusted ledger.

​                      [ ![How Decentralized Identifiers And Bitcoin Fix The Web](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/5e857eab1ac71e393e91b66a8c8eba0235cae021.png/08cf006c01d0d727f4c77b868542bae151e3ef0e.png) ](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)                    

Why I'm rooting for this tech? It solves a couple of use cases but gives us a way to control the use and release of the information about us with  actual utility use. 

DIDs are a shoot on solving the problem of using information about us on the web in a controlled way by a user, not by some third-party application. Will it succeed? Time will tell. 

It relates to my last week's e-mail; there is another attempt from the Ethereum community to develop *the "Sign with Ethereum"* approach. You can try it out on your own at [the LOGIN.XYZ](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) site and read about it ["EIP-4361 spec"](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/).

How is it related to what I wrote the previous week? History likes to rhyme, and so does the history of technology. I see *"Sign with Ethereum"* and DIDs as a repeat of OAuth and OIDC moment of Web 2.0. Sign with  Ethereum creates what Facebook created with its OAuth implementation.  DIDs aim to solve a problem, not just make a quick patch from everyday  use cases. 

Who will win? We will see, but anyway, it is an exciting space to watch. 

***PS. Would you like me to do a longer write-up on those two, tech, use cases, etc.?\***

### Finding your way through Cloud Native stack

Ask five engineers about what "cloud-native" means, and you will get seven  different answers. What you can tell about "cloud-native" understood  through the Cloud Native Computing Foundation lens is that it is  complex. There is plenty of projects with the overlapping scope and use  case. 

How to navigate this space? This interactive map might help you with it - ["CNCF Cloud Native Interactive Landscape."](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)

​                      [ ![CNCF interactive landscape](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/c66266f53bc8d2b7d89486be91827954eb15ef4b.png/b2d9b9153e4f35339de20c08b4fabea943131ee4.png) ](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)                    

It won't make your choices easier, but at least all the projects under  CNCF are here listed in a single place. Explore, enjoy and prosper.



### Earth's digital twin from Nvidia 

Nvidia is on a roll and building new use cases for its leading technology of  GPUs and specific computing power which comes with it. Now they aim to  develop a digital twin for the entire planet - ["Nvidia's New Supercomputer Will Create a 'Digital Twin' of Earth to Fight Climate Change."](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)

What is a "digital twin"? It is a digital representation of the real object  with its state and data, which allows modeling the system based on the  inputs and data stored in the twin. What will come out of it? I will  make a mark to check in a year or two, but anyway, it is an ambitious  undertaking for Nvidia. They clearly are looking to showcase their ["Omniverse"](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) platform with it while doing something worthwhile.



### Release chaos monkeys on your cloud 

Chaos engineering is part of the cloud story - we've all heard about it, but  who is practicing it? Part of why it isn't a standard procedure is that  it requires external tooling. There are projects which address are  released by the community and as commercial tools. Still, it is always  friction if it isn't part of the native stack for a provider. 

Recently major vendors have decided to fill the gap and provide native platform tools to support it. AWS had its ["AWS Fault Injection Simulator,"](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) and to complement it, it released AWS Resilience Hub - ["Measure and Improve Your Application Resilience with AWS Resilience Hub."](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) 

At Ignite, Microsoft released a preview of ["Azure Chaos Studio."](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) This time, Microsoft's team won on naming the service (usually AWS). 

Now you can unleash monkeys on your environment and see what happens. Share your results with us here (drop it to my Inbox). 

### Teach math on p0rnhub? 

Now I wonder how many systems will get this e-mail as spam because I used p0rnhub in the subtitle. Why do I mention this site? 

Innovation is everywhere, and where there is a market, there is demand, and it  will get served. A math teacher decided to use Pornhub as a platform to  deliver its online lessons - ["We Asked the Math Tutor Who Posts His Lessons on Pornhub: Why?"](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/). Apparently ... it works! 

This example shows that no idea is stupid to try out and see if it works!



### Will we collapse under the weight of information? 

I'm a Sci-Fi fan, and being such and growing up in Poland, you can't miss  Stanislaw Lem. In one of his shorts, he told a story based on a  hypothesis that information has a mass. When it reaches critical mass,  it will all disappear in one silent "puff."

Guess what? It seems that someone also read this short and did some thinking about it - ["The information catastrophe."](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) 

*Currently, we produce ∼1021 digital bits of information annually on Earth.  Assuming a 20% annual growth rate, we estimate that after ∼350 years  from now, the number of bits produced will exceed the number of all  atoms on Earth, ∼1050. After ∼300 years, the power required to sustain  this digital production will exceed 18.5 × 1015 W, i.e., today's total  planetary power consumption. After ∼500 years from now, the digital  content will account for more than half Earth's mass, according to the  mass-energy–information equivalence principle.* 

Now we need to wait and see if Lem and the authors of this paper were right.



### What happened with Cosmos DB vuln under the hood? 

Cosmos DB vuln hit the news some time ago as security is always a sensitive  topic when it connects with a cloud. Back then, we got some sparse  information from the team who found it and that it was patched by  Microsoft for its customers. 

Suppose you are interested in what had happened and what was actually the  problem. In that case, you may find this article interesting - ["ChaosDB Explained: Azure's Cosmos DB Vulnerability Walkthrough."](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) It is always interesting to learn from such cases as it also shows the complexity of building the systems at scale. 

### Azure DevOps vs GitHub side-by-side comparison 

Microsoft has two tools with a similar audience - Azure DevOps (ADO) and GitHub  (GH). You don't have to be the smartest guy in the room to figure out  that at one point, they will want to bring them together into one or  focus on a single one of them. Which one? I wrote a piece about it for  my company blog, so to not repeat itself, here it is if you are  interested - ["Azure DevOps vs. GitHub: which one will come out on top?"](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/).

If you are using one of them and you want to see quickly what's on the other side, here is a brief side-by-side comparison - ["A side-by-side comparison of Azure DevOps and GitHub."](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) It is published by Microsoft; still, it doesn't mean that it is wrong.  You can use it to make your first impressions if you know only one of  those tools.



### Space stations, rockets, nuclear fusion, and climate ... what a mix

I will finish this week with a series of news around energy and space.   Let's start with the first one. Have you dreamt about living on a space  station? It looks like you may have a shot at it; at least, it is what  this company claims - ["Orbital Assembly Corporation."](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)

​                      [ ![Orbital Assembly Coporation](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/8559bbe24bdec8820ecbb32dfb00e2ea72d5596c.png) ](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)                    

Far fetched but look, sometimes crazy ideas works. To build it there, you  need to deliver material on the orbit. How? Maybe 200kg at a time. 

Another crazy idea is being pursued by Spinlunch, a startup that just did PoC  that they can throw a rocket out of the slingshot - ["Alternative rocket builder SpinLaunch completes a first test flight."](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) Will it work? Again - I'm not that well informed to answer it now.  Still, it looks like they believe in it, and SpaceX showed plenty of  space to improve our space exploration capabilities. 

Once all of it is in space, it needs power. Solar power is one source, but  what if we would have a better one? One of the companies working on  nuclear fusion says that with a new design, they will make it work by  2030 - ["This Nuclear Reactor Just Made Fusion Viable by 2030. Seriously."](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/).

​                      [ ![Fusion by 2030?](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/0a19e725b0a9391ffffd00e81729b6323796aef5.png) ](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)                    

Not 2300 but 2030. Just ten years from now. 

What does it change, and what it has to do with a climate? 

Nuclear fusion is a promise of a cheap, never-ending (almost) energy source. It is a bet that we will figure out how to solve the climate problem with a new technology advancement like this one. 

On the other hand, if we fail, some people will try to avoid the  consequences, and here orbital stations come into play. If you can  afford it, maybe an orbital station with a nuclear fusion that is good  enough for its purpose will be a solution, but only for a few of us. 

It is crazy to think about the changes which might happen in the next  decade or two, but it is risky to bet everything on the hope that it  will happen. I will quote (from my memory) Elon Musk here - (...) *If there is a 0.01% chance that things will go wrong, we still have only  one planet, and it is a very risky bet to bet against those 0.01% chance* (...).

Not a most optimistic end of the entry. 

​                                                                                                                                          



## Books spotlight 

I've finished ["The Afghanistan Papers,"](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) which I mentioned last week. Good read. Recommended if you are  interested in current geopolitics and recent history. The picture  painted in this book shows no chance of success in this war, as victory  was never defined. I wasn't following it closely, so it was a fast  course over the changes in the policy in the Afghan war. The outcomes of it will unfold in the years to come. 

I've started ["Termination Shock: A Novel"](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) by Neal Stephenson. This is a lighter read from one of my favorite  SciFi authors. I got it in the pre-order as a few other books, and it  landed on my Kindle this week. So far, so good. Reviews come (slowly but surely) to ["GoodReads."](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)

​                                                                                                                                          



## Tools 

I'm deliberately not adding or adding any new tools to my toolkit at the  moment. My focus is right now to better integrate the existing toolset  into my workflow. I keep using Obsidian more and in a more structured  way. It is a tool I definitely plan to keep using. I started to think  about making some of the notes public (later, after I noted it, I found  this site, in Polish, where the guy does exactly that - [https://brain.overment.com/](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)).

I keep automating some of the flows, especially around content  publishing, as it is repeatable work and does not need to be done  directly in real-time. 

There are no new tools here for a while, but maybe some summary write-up on  my toolkit and its usage will happen sometime in the future. 



***[Small last minute update]***

Editing this post I stumbled upon this tool - ["Mediaopoly"](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/). It is for Twitter users and helps you to take a look at yours and other news sources. It looks at the links you (or other account) is posting  and makes simply analytics on the ownership of sources and bias towards  political directions. Here is mine account (I think the results are  skewed because I do not post a lot recently).

## My media corner

I got back to my podcast (in Polish). If you want to listen the story about Meta and its rebranding in audio version, [here it is for you in a "IT i TO" podcast episode](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/). 

There is also a new article on my blog, again idea you are already familiar with about "The need for feedback" ([LINK](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)). Maybe you want to share it with your friends!

Thank you for staying with me here and reading those e-mail. I craft it to  make it worthwhile for you and show you where I am now and with a  current state of thinking and focusing on things. 

Those are not always the most recent and down-to-earth areas, but ~60% of you who read this e-mail every week(ish) still prove that it is worth it. 

Thank you!
