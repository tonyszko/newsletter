# Why and how you need to build your leverage: in work, career and life?



---



Hi, 

 

You need to realize one thing. You only can do THAT much! How much is it? I don't know - it is the individual case, but you need to build leverage  because of that. 

Using leverage is one of the undervalued skills you might be missing in your work and life. 

I observed from my example and watching others that it is tough to  understand this simple concept. Even later in the career and  development, some forces prevent you from using it (badly understood  professionalism and/or ego).

Before I start, two important things:

\#1 - No, it won't be another e-mail about delegation and how important it is (yes, it is important). 

\#2 - No, it won't be about financial leverage and investing. It is a horrible idea unless you know what you are doing. 



With that ... 



### ... why you need leverage? 

I know. You can do it by yourself. I get it. What you need is unlimited time and a lack of distractions. 

Bad news - physics is a bitch. Time goes in one direction only (so far, we  can't change it), and you need rest (I know, you don't - you are  invincible, wait - you will get older). 

There is an endless list of things you want to do. There is also a potential  not to do anything (actually rest). There is and always will be a list  of things that keeps you occupied. Please notice a difference between  something "you want to do" vs. "things which keeps you occupied." 

How to maximize on things you want to do? There are different schools (say  NO more often), but it is a question of how you build and apply  leverage. 



What kind of leverage you have at your disposal:

- time (it is where you start)

- people 

- wealth (eventually) 

- digital (that's something)

Access to different types of leverage and the ability to use it varies  depending on your career and life, what and how you do, and the approach you have towards it (building leverage). Let's explore it. 



### You work your a.. of - leverage on your own time. 

You and all other people start at this point. Your leverage is based on  your time and time alone. Since early days the only thing you can do to  do more is ... to put more time into it. It starts at home (with chores) and school. Then there is a good chance you bring it to work. 

You try to cram as much work in the available time as you can. Yet, there  is always more. You work more time to get rid of it, and the queue is  never empty. There are many reasons for this situation, but two are most important: 

- Physics ... doing things takes time. 

- Other people putting their problem on your heap of things to be done. 

You, me - we both been in this place and done it. It might be that you were  smarter than I and quit it earlier, but I'm guilty as charged. In my  early days, I tried to do all it: work, writing (yeah, to actual paper  newspapers), blogging, speaking, being social. My heap was always full,  and I felt good that I'm doing all this stuff. 

I wasn't aware that often, I was working as leverage for other people. Also, in what I did, I was not using leverage. 

**I was single - 1X!**



### Why are you 1X? 

It is an excellent question. Why? What keeps you doing things, even if often you would be better off letting someone else do it.

I don't have any scientific data on it (read some books), but here are two things I observe over time:

- Badly understood professionalism 

- Your ego 

When I write it, they are the same. Why? You got a task to do, and you can  delegate (it is a place I touch this subject) to someone else in your  team or some external person. You know that you will do it:

- Faster, you don't have to explain what needs to be done with all the details you have in your head for this task. 

- Better, because you did it before and you know how to avoid all the mistakes, you know other people will do. 

You will do it better and faster, and you will save time. But you will do  it on your OWN, and you will miss the opportunity to teach someone else  to do it right in your way.

Congrats, because of such thinking, You missed the opportunity to build your first level of leverage. 



### I will build it better, faster ... first fallacy of a PRO! 

I see it every day at work. Someone with skills decides to do some simple job because she/he will do it better and faster. What is missed here if you are such a person:

- For you, the opportunity to do something more  fun and challenging, which also build your leverage in skills (that is a different topic)

- It is not the task itself that is essential for  the person who could do it. It is the teaching moment itself what allows them to build their skill to leverage others. 

You did great work on writing the document, building beautiful code or  query - you name it. Where you failed is passing the baton and teaching  others to build their advantage. 

False professionalism (and ego in one) tells you that you will do it better  and faster, made you miss your leverage point - doing things through  other people. 

Delegating tasks to people in your team and external people (it requires  additional resource - wealth) is best what you can do for your career in its early and middle stages. It gives you time to focus on building  other parts of your leverage engine. 

Invest your time in teaching others what you know best, and you've done many  times. At first, they will do it slower, they will make mistakes, and  yes, you will have to spend time fixing it. With each repetition, you  will spend less and less time on it, and one day you will notice that  things are getting done. 

Practical hint: If you want teaching moment to be effective, ask the person who did it to document it in some form:

1. It will let them remember it better. 
2. You will have it at hand next time; you will have to give this task to someone. Congrats! Another piece of leverage. 



### Is knowledge leverage? 

OK, is more skills and knowledge leverage? Yes and no. 

Yes, but it is not scaling in time function. Physics is a ... you know  already what it is. You know the topic better will let you do it faster - 20-30% faster. Let's be extreme - 50% faster, or you will put your  knowledge into script or code and do it 90% faster. Still - you've  created another piece of code you need to maintain. If you want it to be your leverage, pass this task to someone else. 

No, if you will not use it to pass it to others and teach them how to do  things you already know. Without using it to teach others and let them  do it instead of you, your knowledge is your ego (I know it, and I will  keep it to myself).

Knowledge gives you leverage only if you use it to build one of two resources:

- Using it to teach others, to get leverage on their time 

- Generate more money to pay for other people's time to do tasks for you. 

Use your knowledge to delegate or automate tasks. If you decide to automate - delegate the maintenance. 



### Money as a leverage

It might not be that obvious for you - it depends on where you are in your career and financially. I remember my friend saying many years ago -  'More I pay for different services, more time I have, and generate more  income,' It was a long time ago but a perfect example of leverage. 

It isn't available for everyone - you need to have a surplus of money and  task you can buy with it, but once you can afford it and there is  potential to do it to gain more free time or generate more income for  you - go for it. 

In a book of Naval, I recommended to you some time ago; there is a simple exercise to be done:

1. Assign a monetary value to your time.
2. Pick a high value, higher than you would earn now - let's say **$1000 per hour** and ask yourself if what you do is worth it.
3. If not - drop it or find someone who will do it for you. 

My example: I do a podcast. I could prepare all audio on my own. Still,  some people can do it better and faster (and can also delegate or  automate it with their knowledge). I can use some of my money to pay for this task and use the time I saved to do something else - for example,  write a newsletter. 

The problem is that this leverage is available to you later in your career  or life. It takes time to build it. The more you will leverage other's  people time, the faster you will get to this point. 

Once you start to have a surplus of time and money, you can begin to use it  to build wealth (no, I'm not going into this direction here, but it is  how it works).

What do people do with more time and some wealth? They build companies!



### Companies are leverage machines. 

There is a good chance you work at the company. What is the company? The company is a leverage machine built on two resources:

- People's time 

- Wealth used to pay for this time and buy resources needed to complete tasks to generate business value. 

How people without wealth build companies? They decide to burn their time  in exchange for future rewards. It is called a startup! 

The next level in building your leverage is to build or own a stake in a  company. It has its limits as well, and that's where leveraging digital  ways of doing things and using your wealth comes into play.



It is a lengthy one, so let's stop here. I will save further thoughts on it for the following e-mail. 



To sum it up for this one:

- There is only THAT MUCH far where you can get on your own time. How much is "THAT MUCH" for you? I don't know. If you  will go beyond it, you risk burnout and pushing you over an edge. 

- You are doing things better and faster is  exactly why you should spend time teaching others to do something. It is your investment in building your leverage on their time. 

- Use your knowledge to delegate and automate. If automating, delegate maintenance. 

- Once you start to have a money surplus, use it to build your leverage in time, delegate tasks and build wealth. 

- Your wealth might let you scale through a  company (or you will decide to burn your time instead of wealth - it is  called startup).

- Companies are leverage machines going on people's time and wealth needed to buy resources.
