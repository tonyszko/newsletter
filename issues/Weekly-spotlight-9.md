# Friday's Spotlight #10

## Zero-sum vs positive-sum game, regulating ML/AI vs need for fact check, books and tools



---



Hi,

Another week has passed and I besides a bunch of links and information at the  end of the e-mail I have also another interesting concept to grasp. Have you thought about "zero-sum" game? 

No ... let's dive in straight into this topic



### Zero-sum vs. positive-sum game thinking



A zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which  an advantage won by one side is lost by the other side, and in the end  sum of benefits won, and losses sum up to ZERO ([read more on Wikipedia if you want](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game)).

A zero-sum game is not a purely mathematical concept. It applies to daily life, and you might be engaged in such a game very often. A simple  example might be a card game with a money pool where money changes hands from one side to another during the game. One side is winning; the  other side is losing. Simple.

In your daily life, you might think that you are engaged in zero-sum  games. It is a standard error in judgment of situation which leads to  the not optimal actions take. You will be much better if you would act  as the case would be something different - a much better situation of  the positive-sum game.

What is this new beast? A positive-sum game is a situation wherein the  exchange or negotiations no one wins at someone else expense. In the  end, a sum of gain or losses is positive (again, dig deeper in theory if you want).

**In most cases of your daily life, you are dealing with a positive-sum  game, but you might react (and people often reacts) as if t would be a  zero-sum game.**

Sounds like academia? Here a couple of examples from this last week.



Person A talks about the business idea with a person(s) B. Person B does not  engage in a business with person A and starts it based on this idea on  its own. Person A thinks he lost in this exchange, yet he still pursuits its original idea but regrets sharing it.

Did Person A lose? Was it a zero-sum game? Both of them do the business,  both of them have customers from the much larger pool, still not  depleted. It is a positive-sum game with a positive outcome for both of  them (and most likely space for many others).

Yet, Person A sees it as its loss or failure of trust (put aside the moral dilemma).



Another one - there is an ample space of services around wannabe podcast hosts. Many people want to get famous by talking to intelligent people (it is  fun, believe me; yet, I think that the famous part is not there :) ).  Because of that, there is a market for people doing podcast editing work (one day to be replaced by AI, of course, but there will still be a  place for good human touch). 

Person A is in the market for podcast editing services and builds a strategy  based on undermining its competition through the comments on its  production. Person B produces the podcasts which are being commented on. 

Is Person A engaged in winning strategy?  Its thinking comes from a  "zero-sum game" thinking where the assumption is that there is a  finished number of wannabe podcast hosts to be served. In reality, every day, someone starts a new podcast, and it is a positive-sum game  market.

Person A would be much better of supporting their competition work with  compliments and providing practical tips to wannabe hosts on how to  improve their great wannabe podcasts as a selling strategy. 



You can build more examples that will relate more to your daily life at home or work:

- A person is withholding the information in the project to create an advantage over a team;
- A person with excellent knowledge about the subject who doesn't share it to develop their position in a company or team; 
- A person who always tries to take advantage of the situation to game their position or status;
- A person who is not delegating their task at work to become "irreplaceable."

Can you think about any other example of "zero-sum game" thinking you  observed in your life (and eating the cake doesn't count)? If you want,  you can share it with me - reply and merge it and share it with others. 

**Whatever actions you are taking, you should always think from a "long haul" perspective.** 

**You will be much better off approaching every situation with "positive-sum" game thinking from a long-term perspective. The most likely problem you are in is a positive-sum game, but people, because of their habits,  approach it with a "zero-sum" mindset.** 

It is triggered by different factors: fear, uncertainty about your  position and skills, status game. In long-term thinking, the "zero-sum"  approach will limit your options and approach. You will find many  thoughts around it in ["Incerto" books by Nasim Taleb](https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-5-Book-Bundle-Randomness-Antifragile-ebook/dp/B08M67TDPN/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=incerto&qid=1619772367&s=digital-text&sr=1-2) (I've recommended some of those to you in earlier e-mails). 

Quoting my all-time favorite comedians from Monty Python in their killer song "Always look at the bright side of life":

*Always look on the bright side of life.* 

*I mean, what have you got to lose?* 

*You know you come from nothing.* 

*You're going back to nothing.* 

*What have you lost? Nothing*

I never thought about it this way, but it is an ultimate way of thinking in a positive-sum game environment. 



Now let's get back to the typical Friday's spotlight dose of information, news, books, and whatever occupied my mind this week. 



​                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)                                                                                            

### Bookmarks spotlight (with a focus on specific trend)

**A case for Europe and AI** 

Here's a loaded one. In general, it calls for a separate e-mail or podcast on  my perspective on Europe and technology advancement. Europe has a  complicated relationship with many things because of:

- Our complex history of nations, conquests, and struggle of powers 
- Our fears coming from our history of nations, conquests, and struggle of powers 

The result of it, and also the result of our current political setup (it is as it is, I'm not making an argument is it good or not) put us in a  great place in history (no wars, no major conflicts, a bit of good  economic fortune in last few decades - not saying about now) but also is a peculiar relationship with technology. 

We know we need it, we know it is a way to build an advantage, but at the  same time, we fear its abuse and try to regulate it. The latest episode  in this area is Europe's attempts to regulate the use of AI - [Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonized rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-regulation-laying-down-harmonised-rules-artificial-intelligence-artificial-intelligence).

I understand a need for regulation in this area in the context of ML and  "AI" (quotes intended) in areas as tracking. Still, on the other side,  we have a long-term approach to European advancement. I fear here that  over-regulating this area will stop us from doing even simple things  around ML because of people being afraid of touching it, with no  tangible result on areas where it is abused. 

From my perspective, Europe is struggling to keep up the pace in technology, and we are losing our advantage if we had any. More regulations on this front, with other countries investing in development in this area, will further back us as a region. 

What are your thoughts about it? I would be glad to hear it, especially if you are closer to this area.


 

**Some regulations are needed - a case of a deep fake.**

When it comes to ML and "AI," it can't be free for all, but it might be too late to stop it. Here's proof - [Dutch MPs in a video conference with deep fake imitation of Navalny's Chief of Staff](https://nltimes.nl/2021/04/24/dutch-mps-video-conference-deep-fake-imitation-navalnys-chief-staff).

We are coming to the point that we should stop believing in anything we  hear, read or see on the Internet or other media. Technology to enable  anyone to fake other people's voices, videos, or style of  speaking/writing is at the commodity stage. You don't need a lot of  money or knowledge to use it. 

What will be the result? An environment in which everything you  read/hear/see can be faked. How to deal with it? A solution might be  more of the same - more ML and "AI" to counter such a trend and do an  automated analysis and fact-checking. 

Do we have it? Not right now. Will we have it? Regulations like the one I've mentioned above might slow such efforts down. 

How to solve it? 

How are you doing your fact-checking right now? Tools? Routine? 



​                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)                                                                                            

### Tools spotlight 

Keeping in the same area - how to tell if a person you are speaking with or  reading its comments on Twitter is a bot. Here's a tool that tries to  tackle it - [Bot Sentinel](https://botsentinel.com/). 

Bot Sentinel is a tool using ML to try to identify Twitter accounts with  suspicious activities and patterns. I use it for years now, and I've  found it helpful; you may try it on your own if you are a Twitter user. 

Are such tools our future? I think they are, and using it will be more  common in the future also in the context of the text, audio, and video.  Using such automated systems to triage and fact-check information or  parties will be a standard part of our workflow. It will happen sooner  than later. 



​                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)                                                                                            

### Books spotlight 

[Alchemy: The Dark Art and Curious Science of Creating Magic in Brands, Business, and Life](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DCWRG3/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title) - I've picked this one from random recommendation with the expectation  that it will be around marketing and brands, but it is more profound. It is touching the marketing side of life. The author works in this  industry, but it focuses a lot on how we think and perceives things  through the prism of brands, needs, and hidden reasons. 

It also discusses how our brains work in this context, what types of tasks we are well at and not, and how they are exploited in different  settings. One very interesting topic touched on is thinking in "placebo  effect" terms outside of the pharma industry. 

I've found this book exciting and inspiring to think about different topics in a bit of other concepts. Try it.



That's all folks. Stay safe, spring is coming to the northern hemisphere. Take advantage of it.

Till the next time
