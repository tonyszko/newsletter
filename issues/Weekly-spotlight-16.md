# Friday's spotlight #16

##  Where we fall short in our expertise? Different look at roles and skills, worrying trend with devices  ... and more



---



 Hi

I hope last week was good for you as it was for me. It was also busy, and that's why this Friday's spotlight hits your Inbox on Monday. Social  media rules would say that I broke regular" 'writing'" and you are  losing your "habit" and that I will lose an audience. You know what -  why should we care about it. 

Writing this newsletter is my personal commitment, and I stick to it. With a great pleasure, but also with some hiccups.

Those pictures are two sides of the same place. If you curious where it is, the answer is at the end of the e-mail in a note. 





﻿**Why I try to start with "What I don't know position"?**

There is a trap in which you and I fall, especially if it is around something you do or your current area of expertise. It is an **"I know it"** trap. 

﻿But, I think now, that deliberate attempt to get out of it and put yourself  in a position of "I don't know" is something I and you as well need to  do more often. 

Let's face it - problems and solutions are similar. After some time in any  field, you start to recognize the issues and patterns. It is called  experience and domain-specific knowledge. During my time with IAM  solutions, I knew what I would propose to the customer after the first  30 minutes of conversation. Solutions were typical. At some point, I  could scope the project and put a price tag on it almost without talking to the customer first. I would not be a way off from what I will  deliver after a few hours or days of scoping.

It is **"I know it"** in my specific domain. There are other cases. 

You work with someone - your peer or customer, and you see that they do  something in a way, which is wrong. So they should do it differently.  Why? Because you know it will be a better way to do it. You've done it  before, and it always worked.

In a more drastic (or less polite way), it is also a situation when you  hear that someone says, "they are stupid to do it this way" or "they do  it wrong, but they will not listen to me." In both cases, you might be  correct, it might be a solution or the right way to do it, but it might  also be a case of the "I know it" trap.

The truth is that people do things in a certain way for a reason we might  not be aware. So the solution for them might be different than for ten  other customers you worked for because of something you don't know.

It is effortless to fall into this trap that you know better, especially  as a consultant or when you are coming to the situation as an expert in a field. But, unfortunately, it is what the world expects from you. Isn't it.

Now I beg to differ. Every time you are in a situation, there is one crucial question you should ask yourself

**What is it that I do not know about it?**

Why they do things in this way? Assume they are not stupid, not lazy, and  are educated. Still, at the same time, they do things differently than  you or what is a piece of common knowledge about it. Is there something  you don't know about this situation?

Why haven't they implemented this system yet? Is it inertia or lack of  skills? Or is there something you don't know about their situation that  makes this solution not a good match for them?

I observed that I often responded to some thread or commented on social  media with a comment stating the truth and facts how I know it. The  response was sound and based on best practices and technology in the  given field. Yet, after few exchanges with an author, I've learned that  it is not a lack of knowledge but some things I didn't know, making them choose a different path.

Yes, many times, you will find a lack of knowledge on the receiving end.

Yes, it will be pure inertia often, doing things the way they always did it.

Yes, people will act stupidly or will be plain lazy.

Yet if you want to develop and do your best work expected from you, in  every situation where you are ready to come with a solution, you should  ask yourself this single question.

**What is it that I don't know about this situation?** 

I thought about it for some time now. Still, in last weeks I listened to a great episode of The [Knowledge Project podcast](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/) (recommended as a whole): [Rethinking your position](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/adam-grant2/) with guest Adam Grant. It is an excellent summary of why you should put yourself in a place of "I don't know" more often if you want to develop further.

My resolution: ask me "what I don't know" more often.

Now let's go through your weekly dose of my results of digging through the  Internet: links, books, news, and sometimes helpful or not so many  things from last week.

**Why I'm not bullish on tech in Europe**

I have a draft of a blog post with the working title as stated above.  Still, in short - I'm not bullish when it comes to technology  development and invention coming from Europe. There are many reasons, to name a few: demography, political situation; Europe is a region of  multiple countries, nations, and languages. All of it contributes to the fact that not many technology companies and inventions come from  Europe. You should not expect (assume I'm wrong).

​                      [ ![Europe's Software Problem](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/81c9f7d111c609c518d0a6e9e8b627a9dfd83c93.jpeg/5a2b78c8d4a3d3d48d457ee6507cf4ff5d68a4cc.jpeg) ](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/europes-software-problem/)                    

Bert Hubert wrote an excellent blog post around this subject -[ Europe's software problem](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/europes-software-problem/). Bert writes about the need for Europe to come up with its software to  enable people in Europe to invent and not be dependent and not feed the  US and other countries' tech companies. 

It is more a result than a cause, and as it should happen, it will not  help, and it will not solve the issue. Sadly as it sounds, I think it is a slippery slope for Europe in technology as much as I would want to be wrong about it (and I will celebrate if I will be proven wrong about  it).

Read Bert's piece and think about it, happy to get to know your thoughts.



﻿**Who owns your button?**

When Amazon released a Dash button, I was looking at it as a small wander.  The community welcomed it, and people used it for any purpose other than the original purpose envisioned by Amazon (shop with it). Now Amazon  decided to terminate the product. What is more important also issue an  update to brick all the Dash buttons out there.

I've learned about it from Chris Mullins's blog - [Rescue Your Amazon Dash Buttons](https://blog.christophermullins.com/2019/12/20/rescue-your-amazon-dash-buttons/), where Chris goes through details of how Dash works and what to do about it. Even if you don't own the Dash button, you can read it for the pure joy of engineering.

Why be bothered with it if you are not a Dash owner (or you are)? Because  it is an example of a trend where a manufacturer decides to terminate  and brick or make the product useless. The product you have bought and  you own. The previous well-known example is [Sonos ](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21042871/sonos-recycle-mode-trade-up-program-controversy)who offered a trade-in program and discount on new equipment if you will allow them to brick your model to make it useless.

It is wrong. Do not support it but do not brick it. It is not you who owns it. Let people use it, tinker with it, flash it but do not brick it on  purpose. There is an excellent short story from Corey Doctorow -  Unauthorized Bread; it shows where we might end with such an approach.





If we spent a lot of time trying to figure out at my company, those were  two things: bonus system(s) and role matrix to describe required skills  for different roles and levels. If people are sensitive to something at  jobs, believe me, it is a job title and description. I know cases when  people quit the job only because the title has changed, not a job or  responsibilities.

As an aspiring adept of Wardley Maps, I immediately read this LinkedIn  post from Guy Dickinson on my reading list - Skills as a System. The  conclusion from it? 

**Activities, not job roles, support strategic decisions**

*The way we use job roles to think and talk about skills and expertise is  too rigid – they're built for yesterday's understanding of what created  value, and calcify our conversation and decision making when we try to  plan for change with leaders.*

Do not focus on roles and requirements. Instead, look at activities needed to push us forward and then on skills and expertise required for these  activities. 

Interesting read, especially if you are involved in mapping roles and skills needed for your team or organization.

That's it for this week - a bit shorter, but I hope you still found it  interesting. Little head's up - in the next two weeks, I will be  enjoying my holiday time and stay more in the off-line mode. So it might affect my time to respond to your e-mails, but the following two issues of this newsletter might contain more of my thoughts and insights than  links and news.

You've been warned.

I hope you will still enjoy it the same way I enjoy writing those e-mails and talking to this small but growing community we have here. Thank you for being here.

I took a couple of books with me for a holidays. Here's my list of reading for next two weeks. Maybe you will find something for you:
