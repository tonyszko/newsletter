# Friday's spotlight #15

## Dark arts of attacking decision making, look into a brain, fragility ... and more 



---



Hi 



This week brought a lot. Yesterday I attended a party in person at our office (we can call it HQ). 

Doh! I wasn't aware that I missed meetings F2F with people in a larger group that much. We all will have to learn a bit about how to get back and  find a new balance after this period of change triggered by pandemics. 

That's in physical life - and here is next Friday's spotlight coming to your  Inboxes with a couple of new people joining us. Drip by drip, and we are building a small community here.

Any feedback or thought on making it better and providing something that  will help you build your career, enjoy it, and pass some of my  experience to you - appreciated. E-mail me, and you know what will  happen ... you are risking I will respond:). 

As usual, you will find many links and resources in the second part of  this e-mail, but before that, something on a little darker note. 



**Do you want to play that game?**

[Krzysztof (Chris) Daniel](https://kda.zone), a strategic consultant from LEF who happened to be a guest on my [podcast ](https://share.transistor.fm/s/1aaa4942)and sometimes my speaking/tweeting sparing partner, published a short but great post on attacks on the decision-making process: 

[>>> How to defend yourself against attacks on your decision processes (LINK)?](https://www.kda.zone/post/how-to-defend-yourself-against-attacks-on-your-decision-processes) <<<

Krzysztof worked with organizations and wrote it in the context of organizational decision-making at a strategic level. Still, I allowed myself to extend it to my career and work level. It applies to your daily 

What if?

- Someone understands you and the environment a bit better than you because (s)he pays attention to it.
- What if this person has malicious intent to divert you into a situation you are not playing on your strengths? 
- What if you fall victim to it, and you go along those lines? 

It might happen in the business. Krzysztof gives some example of such attack and malicious attempts:

*The attack on a decision process can take different forms:*

- *In the military, you can leave a place  weakly protected to bait your enemy into grabbing it and overstretch its supply lines, which reduce your opponent ability to react somewhere  else.*
- *In business, you may promise a competing  startup a partnership deal if only they implement a few features. Of  course, nobody needs those features; you are just buying time.*
- *In business, if you want to enter your  supplier market, you can ask the supplier for an unreasonable request,  such as 30 years of security maintenance for a phone. It will take them  3-6 months to evaluate your demands.*
- *In politics, if you need a strong moral  imperative to do what you want, you can push someone's buttons and use  the reaction to justify your actions.*

It might also happen in your career or life. What for it might take? 

- In a project, someone diverts your attention  towards the specific situation, knowing that this particular situation  will trigger your anger, to play it later to your disadvantage 
- Someone might assign you a task or job which is  not in your core skill set, using a trigger for you to accept it with an intent to undermine your professional position. 

Those are dark examples, but it happens. What is the key to not fall into those traps? 

**Awareness.** 

To protect against those attacks on you or your organization, you need to  be aware that it might happen, recognize this situation and be able to  resist it or reflect that you fall into it. 

The situation where someone forces you in one way or another to play  against your strengths is a red flag (paraphrased from the post). I  wrote in one of the previous e-mails - you should learn what your  strengths are and play on them. Without awareness about it, you might  fall prey to such dark art and be forced to play on your weak hand to  your disadvantage. 

What can you do when you recognize such a pattern? 

**Here is a thing - you can walk away.** 

It is always something you can do. You don't have to try to overturn it to your advantage; you don't have to fight it. If you don't see a way to  play on your strengths, you can decide not to play the game. Many people assume that the game has to be played, and it is not the case. 

You can't walk away from all the situations, but choose games you play. 

As much as I always look for a positive outcome, I decided to write about  it as those things and patterns happen all the time. You can't allow it  to cloud your judgment and seek dark ways in every behavior or action,  but being aware of it and learning to recognize it is an excellent skill to have in your pocket. 

Krzysztof did a great thing to put it in a simple blog post form - read it and  think if and how it applied to you in the past. Look and think if you  were the subject of such an attack and its outcome. 

Good thought exercise. Not a pleasant one.

### Bookmark's spotlight

This week the choice was hard. For an unknown reason, the number of quality  information, topics, and sources landing on my browser were astonishing. I will tape it in the weeks to come; here are some highlights for you  for a weekend and week to come.

**Business and IT and the cloud** 

How many times you've heard it? Business and IT. Have you ever heard  "business and HR" or "business and accounting"? Nope? I'm not surprised  at all. 

Business and IT relationships are complicated. It complicates at the  organization level but then streams down to our career paths. What if I  tell you that you don't have to choose between it the hard way? The  trail from now on is incorporating IT into a business. The Sooner  someone will understand it, the better prospects and the future awaits  them ahead. 

Here is another excellent whitepaper from Leading Edge Forum (now DXC):

[Building and Leveraging Advanced Business/IT Relationships](https://leadingedgeforum.com/media/1842/building-and-leveraging-advanced-business-it-relationships.pdf).

Why do you should read it? I'm convinced that it works in the same way at a personal career level. The more you shift towards "Partner" and "Peer"  in this relationship, the better outlooks for your career and  development. 

​                      [ ![Building and Leveraging Advanced Business/IT Relationships](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/2087e97f3668c5b58ce6ec8f34fcbcfd9369f3ae.png) ](https://leadingedgeforum.com/media/1842/building-and-leveraging-advanced-business-it-relationships.pdf)                    

It doesn't mean ditching technical skills. It is a common theme and fear  that comes out in the discussions I have with people in technology. It  is about how you see your role, how you operate, what tactics you are  using. 

​                      [ ![Provider role - you don't want to be here](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/eb2d0e7f5a6f3374d086532558994a3fe10e3ee2.png) ](https://leadingedgeforum.com/media/1842/building-and-leveraging-advanced-business-it-relationships.pdf)                    

Yet unlikely you think it is that it applies to you at the moment, you should spend a time and read it. 



**Browse (not yet) your brain**

This one caught me because of my recency bias to pick up new information from my memory, in this case after reading "[A Thousand Brains](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54503521-a-thousand-brains)" (recommended some time ago here). 

Don't have any practical use for it at the moment, but here is information  about Google's project on getting data about neocortex of human - [A Browsable Petascale Reconstruction of the Human Cortex](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/06/a-browsable-petascale-reconstruction-of.html).

Damn it. It is data on one cubic centimeter of our neocortex, and we need  1.5PB (petabyte) to store its structure. Mind (sic!) blowing but also  shows how much we still need to learn about ourselves. Suppose you don't plan to use this data set. In that case, I recommend going through the "[Explore](https://h01-release.storage.googleapis.com/explore.html)" and "[Gallery](https://h01-release.storage.googleapis.com/gallery.html)" sections to educate yourself. 

It is all sitting under your skull and lets you read this e-mail. In some  cases, in a foreign language, process, store running on a fraction of  energy which powers device you use to read it. Think about it. 



**Open Source and its sustainability** 

I've touched on Open Source a few times. It is here to stay; that's a fact.  We haven't figured out (as an industry) an excellent way to sustain it  and fund its development. What is the result: 

.[NET Open Source: What Happens When the Free Lunch Ends?](https://aaronstannard.com/dotnetoss-free-lunch-ends/)

I do not include it here to highlight drama around Identity Server (a  brilliant piece of software). It is a good description of the dynamics  around Open Source projects and development. If you use it or contribute to it, think about these dynamics and how you fit into them. Can you  contribute , or can you stomach the project's cost if it will go  commercial?

Thinking about how to use Open Source in the organization should and will be one of the functions of architects and consultants. It is one of the new  practices which we need to create as an industry. 

Is it already there for you? How you make decisions around Open Source  projects in your infrastructure or apps? What are the criteria? How you  plan for changes in those projects? Are you monitoring it ? 



**Is it better to have a stable or volatile job?**

We all are looking for safety to some degree, but is safety and stability  good for us? Would it be good if someone would say to us, "you are  fired" once in a while? You've heard about Nassim Taleb from me both as a person and his works, so here is the last time for a bit - a good panel with NNT:

[ Covid was not a black swan.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TZaX16o2uI)

​                      [ ![Covid was not a black swan](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/607bf2c41cb693b8588cf279e45da7243d113d95.png/4eb4659f7a5b087506a1bc84111f1a88b9e9c2b0.png) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TZaX16o2uI&)                    

Worth watching and think about it in your context. If volatility is suitable  for a system, am I experiencing one? To what degree? Should I seek to  introduce a bit of it into my daily life to be better prepared for the  future? 

It is good to look at it from a different angle and question if stability  around me is good for me? Or if you don't have stability, ask yourself a question:

- Is it wrong, or does it make me stronger? 
- Is it enough to make me stronger and not to harm me? 

Good thinking model to apply to life, job, career choices. 



​                                                                                                                                          

**Tool's spotlight**

**To use or not to use a password manager?** 

My early day's background was insecurity, and it still can get me to the  rabbit hole of information around it. Here's one which is very practical for all of us - Tavis Ormandy wrote his analysis on using or not using a password manager: [Password Managers](https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/passmgrs.html). To counter it, here is a thread with [polemics ](https://twitter.com/benadida/status/1401657846983380996)to this post. 

If you don't know Tavis, he is a well-respected researcher working for  Google. One of those people who did things and got the attention of the  security world once he is speaking. 

My approach? I use a password manager - it is 1Password in my case (not an advertisement), looking at BitWarden. With all these possible problems, the benefit, especially in a family setting, is a more prominent than  likely risk. 



Enough for this week. I throw a lot at you already. 

Happy to get positive feedback from you about the newsletter and podcast (for those who listen to it), in some cases even in person (yeah, we are  getting there). 

If you have any - positive or not, e-mail it to me or grab me for a chat if you will spot me.
