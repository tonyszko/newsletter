# Weekly  (Friday's) Spotlight #20

## Pace yourself and the art of  sustainability,how to work hard, more AI assisted work, books and more



---



Hi

Welcome to a new week. Holidays and travel schedules skewed a publishing  schedule for this newsletter. It becomes "Weekly" rather than  "Friday's." There are lessons learned from it, and those are twofold:

\#1 - Don't be overoptimistic about delivering things and your time.  Sometimes you end up in a place with no Internet (like no Internet), and you will have to spend time in a different way than you assumes

\#2 - Things will not fall apart if something is pushed a day or two, but  (and it is a bit BUT) do not use it as an excuse or general rule. 

Yet, it looks - I'm back with you for an excellent start to the week. I  charged my batteries with almost three weeks of holidays and travel,  easy but intensive workouts, and swimming in the sea. I have to admit  that after this period, having a sea close by to finish my morning run  with a swim is a bit higher on a life's list (if you are curious, I  don't have such a list as a solid plan).

I got back on a weekly release schedule today with a few thoughts about  pacing yourself and a few things that caught my eye when I used the  Internet. 

The weekly spotlight is back.

﻿***Housekeeping note:\*** *If you have some rule in your Inbox on the "Friday's spotlight" phrase,  please update it to "Weekly spotlight" as I will be moving toward this  subject line**. You don't want to get caught in the spam net of your provider.***

### ﻿﻿**Optimize for sustainability** 

It is not an excuse for a newsletter issue not being released on time.  Still, recently I solidified my thinking about the intensity of doing  things. **Instead of optimizing for output, I optimize for sustainability.** 

It is not a rapid change; instead, I thought about how I want to do things and how I do it, but it wasn't named so far. Sustaining activities over a long time is more important than stretching yourself to the limit for high output. The thing is - society around us tells us differently.

Society around you tells you to push harder, do more, optimize to cram more  into each hour. You see people achieving, doing things that seem not  reachable, and sharing X tips for improving your productivity. When you  see such a person attain their goals while running an ultra-marathon and taking care of five kids at the same time, there might be a question in your head: *Why I can't do it**?*

It is a wrong question. The good one is - Should I do it in this way? Even if you can wake up at 4 AM (nothing wrong with it, I know people who do it and build their daily rhythm around it), and put 14hrs or work every day, is it a way to go? 

Let me share a story here: ***I've never been on a diet\***. I know people need to follow the diet for health reason, or it is a way they control their weight (I follow my friend at 50in500.com who take  on his path to lose some weight), so I'm not sharing it to say diet is  wrong. 

For me, diet is not sustainable. 

Diet means the elimination of some food or limiting your daily intake (or  both). My problem with diet is that if I use it to control my weight, I  need to stick to it forever and say goodbye to a particular food. It  will be a never-ending on/off diet cycle. It is not sustainable in the  long run. 

What I do instead is:

- Trying to eat reasonably healthy and reasonably in size
- Put exercise in my daily routine to make sure I'm getting enough move to counterbalance energy from food.
- Observe the trajectory of my vitals. 

Yesterday I had a pizza and a beer. I never looked how many calories it had or  can I eat it. I know I will no do it every day, I had my 15k run before  it, and I know my vitals are good and steady. 

I optimize it for sustainability in the long run. I don't want to be  stressed about something I need to do daily (food) and restrained  forever, so I know I need to pace myself around the long run. So far, it works great for me with steady weight over a couple of years. 

Another example is my approach to writing and publishing online. I could commit to write every day or record every day/week for my podcast and start a  YouTube channel too to it. I can run it like it for a while;  you can  see people do it, and social media algorithms and audience rewards them  with reach and attention (assuming they have something to say).

The high chance is I would drop all of it after a month or two. It isn't  sustainable - at least for me (I know people do it for years). I pace  myself. I do:

- One newsletter a week 
- Weekly podcast alone or with a quest
- Occasional blog post (this will change into a regular one, I promise :) )
- Some social media posting. 

But I pace myself here to not burn out of ideas and my will to do it to  sustain those activities over a long time. Scot Hanselman talked about  the same approach to deliver high-quality output over a long period in  his video.

​                      [ ![Scott: Pace yourself](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/f0302197b8e379ffb663b583100dba76e2bdedb4.png) ](https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1402413793389412355)                    



Those are examples from my private life, but I try to take the same approach  for my professional life or tasks I need to do. You can work hard and do 20 or 30 things on your To-Do list daily. Then finish the work  exhausted but with an "I did it" approach. Nothing wrong with pushing  things and the "I did it" approach. Our brain is built to reward it. The highest rewarded skill in our professional settings is moving things  towards completion.

Pace yourself. 

Observe not only the output metric (how much you did or achieved) but also other "metrics":

- How do you feel physically and mentally?
- Are you keeping pace in other areas, not only achieving the work results?
- What you are sacrificing to achieve the results (there always is something), and how do you feel about it. 

There is nothing wrong with being an achiever and have high output. Think if  you can sustain it over a long period. Can you do it at the pace you are doing it right now for the next one or two years or five? 

Pace yourself. 

Pacing yourself means you might slow down or speed up and also that there will also be periods of crunch (pizza and a beer) that require you later to  rest or calm a bit. Everything has a price, and if you speed up, you  need to pay it later.

Important. Pace yourself against you, not others. You can improve, you can set  goals in what you are doing, but pacing yourself against others will  lead you to compare yourself to them.

### ﻿﻿**Bookmark's spotlight**

Last week I wrote about GitHub Copilot and "AI," which primed my news intake as there was a lot of "AI" related news last week. I had a deficient  intake of information in the previous three weeks, so it dominated my  feed a bit. How to manage "intake of information" is what I will cover  next week - I got a question about it from one of you, but now ... let's jump to the news. 

﻿﻿**Black Mirror's scenarios are here**.

Have you watched "Black Mirror," a series on Netflix about possible future  scenarios with technology (not always going as we envisioned it)? There  was an episode in which "AI" was used to re-create late people to still  talk with them. An effort to do it is also going. Still, this week I saw this news: ["New Anthony Bourdain documentary deepfakes his voice."](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578707/anthony-bourdain-documentary-deepfake-voice?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4)

I didn't know who Anthony Bourdain was. Still, the creator of a  documentary movie about him used "deep fake" AI to put his speech in the film, quoting things he hasn't recorded. It wasn't mentioned, and  someone caught it by asking about the source of those quotes. It is  entertainment, you may say, and there's nothing wrong with it. There  isn't, but my point here is:

- Technology got to the point that such use of it will become (already is) common. 
- As a society and as individuals need to learn  how to deal with it, starting with the rules of engagements, such video  and audio recording should be marked as AI created?

I expect more and more "creativity" around the use of "deep fake" from  the entertainment industry but also from criminals (call me pessimist  here).

﻿﻿**AI-assisted research in quantum physics**

I wrote about GitHub Copilot and the future of AI-assisted work. It  stretches not only for computer science but also for quantum physics. "[AI Designs Quantum Physics Experiments beyond What Any Human Has Conceived"](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-designs-quantum-physics-experiments-beyond-what-any-human-has-conceived/) writes about research based on AI-generated concepts in a quantum physics field. 

Does "AI" understands what it generates? I don't think so. I don't believe  that this algorithm understands what 'photon' is and why it is crucial.  What it does it iterates on possibilities at a much faster pace than  humans can do and generates outputs, then improving itself on it. 

The world around you will get more and more filled with such tools  crunching data, experiments, images faster than you and providing output even if it is not that intelligent to understand what is is crunching  on. 

BTW - if you are interested in science and physics, one of my favorite go-to sites is Quanta Magazine ([LINK](https://quantamagazine.org/)) when I want to read something about it. Check it out; maybe you will find it interesting you.



﻿﻿**How to work hard?**

I don't believe in shortcuts and free lunch. I wrote about it in my blog post - [Lessons learned so far](https://www.onyszko.com/lessons-learned/) when you expect some outcome, you need to apply for work. The question  is - how hard do you need to work, and what does "hard work" means? 

[﻿Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/bio.html) is (in his own words) a "programmer, writer, and investor." He is a VC  investor, and as I have my thoughts about this model, Paul writes an  excellent essay on his blog. One of the recent ones is ["How to Work Hard."](http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html) You will not find "TEN tips how to work hard" there, but it is worth reading. 

I could relate to this essay so that when I find something interesting,  the "hard" part is not an issue. Still, also you need to know how to  work hard and when to stop (pace yourself) as there is always a question "what is hard enough" and "am I working too hard on it."



﻿﻿**Learning technology, a kid's book way to learn Kafka**

This one came to me through my friend's Piotr Stapp feed - what if we would learn technology through a color book for kids? ["Gently down the stream"](https://www.gentlydownthe.stream/) is a book which explains the basics of Kafka. It does it pretty well.  It will not teach you nuts and bolts, but you will have a pretty good  understanding of what Kafka does and the basic terms around it after  going through it. 

​                      [ ![Gently Down The Stream](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/417e1cc237ef92698c37ad5f2736fd9222a4aec9.png/8d1c856bd2b780548086b456419457a54543db72.png) ](https://www.gentlydownthe.stream/)                    

The hard part is not knowing but how to pass it to others in an accessible  form. A book like this could be a great way to introduce kids and  complex technology.

BTW - if you have kids or you want to give some presents for a kid to introduce them to technology, I recommend [miro:bit](https://microbit.org/). I bought some basic kits for my kids to play during the summer, and it  is fun down and prepares them for more complex things in the future.  Worth every penny/cent or PLN :).



﻿﻿**Solve the future puzzle in Neurocracy.**

For the end something for summer, a lazy time for people who like to solve puzzles and Sci-Fi. [Neurocracy](https://neurocracy.site/) is a narrative and a game - solve a mystery puzzle by reading a  Wikipedia-style history. It unfolds every day; it gets bigger. You can  treat it as a book or as a game. 

Interesting project created in an interesting form - using Wikipedia concept we are all familiar with but not to deliver knowledge but to create writing  and entertainment. I'm not sure if I will keep up with it daily, but I  will check how it unfolds from time to time. Check it out of curiosity,  and maybe you will stay in a rabbit hole for a bit longer.



﻿﻿**Appreciate the geeks: demo scene on a floppy drive**

You have to appreciate geek's work when you see one. Are you into the demo  scene? I used to be in my 8-bit times and later in early PC. Demos  always pushed coding to the limit fitting crazy graphics and effects  into small chunks of code running on a computer. 

​                      [ ![Freespin: demo running on floppy drive alone](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/5f3326365742ba571759df170b216a68fe38bdf8.png/e7a2d2a8c47a4c69ba2a145c75024f1f9267c474.png) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zprSxCMlECA)                    

What if you cut a computer out of the equation? This guy did a [demo running without C64 only on its floppy drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zprSxCMlECA). Pretty awesome (and not practical, but still awesome). See it for yourself.

### ﻿﻿**Book's spotlight**

I'm going through my holidays' pile of books and keep adding a new one. Right now, I'm going through ["Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945"](https://www.amazon.com/Postwar-History-Europe-Since-1945/dp/B004IDNQOW/). Gosh, it is fascinating - maybe because I remember those things  mentioned in school, but here with more details and context. If you want to understand Europe better or/and you are into history (but also if  you are not) - grab it. 

​                                                                                                                                          

### ﻿﻿**Content spotlight**

Primarily for my Polish readers - I released a couple of podcast episodes in the  last weeks. You may want to check it out on an "IT i TO" podcast  website, but if you want some highlights, check:

- The recent one on a "personal branding" in IT: [#13: Marka osobista w IT: hit czy kit?](https://it-it-to.transistor.fm/episodes/14-marka-osobista-w-it-hit-czy-kit)
- Interview with Daniel Stefaniak about the reality of building Azure cloud from the inside: [#11: Chmura od środka prosto z Redmond - Daniel Stefaniak](https://it-it-to.transistor.fm/episodes/11-chmura-od-srodka-prosto-z-redmond-daniel-stefaniak)

I'm still trying to figure out how to do the podcast in English and still  pace me, so if you are not a Polish listener, stay tuned and  patient—also adding a new website for a podcast to my to-do list. 

​                                                                                                                                          

That's it for this week. 

It was a great start to the week to write this newsletter for you gals and gents. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I wanted to write it to my morning cup(s) of coffee.

Questions, comments, random thoughts? I'm here reading it - write me an e-mail,  and I will do my best to provide a sane answer to it.
