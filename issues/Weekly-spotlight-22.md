# Weekly  Spotlight #22:

## Appreciation of life in an example, how to handle  information overload - a recipe, news on China, tech, education and  privacy



---



That's an empty line.



It is a line missing a previous e-mail. I wasn't sure I could deliver  something valuable to you last week, so I've decided not to write it. If it wasn't a thing I would read myself and I couldn't divide the  attention needed to turn it into such a piece, it didn't feel right.  Quality over quantity, quality matters - put some well-known phrase  about it here. 

All the marketing gurus would point me a few mistakes - you have to keep a  schedule and be consistent, but here's the thing. When I was asked, "Why I'm doing it?" I could answer, "Because I can." The beauty in it is  that there is no "have to" in this answer, as well as there is no "have  to" in you reading it :).

That's a much better relationship than product or sales based with a need to "generate something."

This summer is hitting a bit my productivity and creativity. I will not hide it (hard to hide it looking at the schedule of e-mails), but sometimes  you should not try to fight against the current. Recovering and  adjusting to the usual rhythm after a period of holidays and travel. 

*Self-observation: The pandemic period contributed to it, as there were no many  opportunities to get off the train and train this "hop on"/"hop off"  routine between work and travel. A change makes a bigger wave and makes  it a bit harder to get back on track and pace. Again, not complaining,  not an excuse - observing myself.* 

Last weekend was a bit special. I had a chance to meet many people from the  company at the annual meeting (which we skipped last year). Boy, that is fun (of course, with some calculated risk but also mitigated as much as possible). I missed the energy, the talks with people, and seeing them  around. 



**Let's start with something unexpected and heavy weight.** 

I've never met Abel Wang; he worked at Microsoft and delivered tons of  technical content. I stumbled upon his profiles in recent months and  looked a bit at them. He passed away from cancer last week. Why speak  about someone whom you don't know who passed away? 

I had this [video of Abel speaking with Scott Hanselman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPfMW0CZpms) in my queue to watch, and I finally did it before I got to know he  passed away. I knew it was recorded when he was already ill (again), but I didn't think he passed away a bit over a month after recording it. 

​                      [ ![Get Busy Living with Abel Wang - Hanselminutes Podcast #793](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/b6f2ad27cc4649cd3515bbd8e7d2a2092434a7a9.png/44e935e4e603d464e5419b4134af35a23facdb83.png) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPfMW0CZpms)                    

This conversation is one ***of the best appreciation of life and discussion about it that I saw for a long time\***. You have to appreciate also the way those guys speak and how open they  are to each other. It will not teach you some new skills. It will not  give you a new recipe for doing more or delivering more. It will not put some easy to repeat phrases in your head, but anyway, it is worth  watching it for 30+ minutes.

It might be my personal story (my dad passed away from cancer, and few  friends are affected by it), but it resonated with me. Not as a story of fighting cancer (there is not much of it there) but as a story of  appreciation of life and joy.

Abel, you will be missed by your family and friends. You will be missed a bit by the world around us (as every person); we need more people who  appreciate life in this way.



### Avoiding information overload and FOMO

I got a question about how I stay up-to-date and also avoid information  overload. First of all, I don't try to keep up-to-date; yet, many people pointed out that I'm still achieving it (at least in some of the  areas). 

It might be because of my natural inclination to ingest the information,  manifesting itself in reading many books, articles, and papers on  various topics. I don't know if you believe in personality tests, but  here are my TOP 5 Gallup's strengths, which indicate that I'm an  information sucker. 

​                      ![My TOP Gallup Strengths](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/f64d37e832d1480a40de6be30582d6a220cb1014.png)                    

In the past (years ago), I've curated a list of sources, blogs, and  articles to read. I had my own RSS feed gathered and later used the  Flipboard app (even don't know if it still exists) to replace it. Then I went over all those sources to read what had happened and be up-to-day.

That was when I had been affected by the information FOMO.

Years ago, I got a chance to have a one-to-small group meeting with some  people, including Mark Russinovich, who was asked the same question.

 
His answer was somewhere along these lines: ***you don't need to follow all those sources, monitor some high-level  aggregation, and if there is something important, it will find its way  to you\*.
**

Turns out he was right. The key is to let go of FOMO of not knowing. You  don't have to know about something first or even as a first million  people. You don't have to know about it at all or only get to know when  you need it. In most cases, it will find a way to reach you. You need  this sensing mechanism to signal that something is going on or there is  something to check.

I stopped harvesting and curating my information feed and turned it into  the more passive approach, focusing on feeding my feed. I focus more on  my ["sensing machine"](https://www.onyszko.com/sensing-machine/) than on the content itself. At the moment, it comes from:

I stopped harvesting and curating my information feed and turned it into  the more passive approach, focusing on feeding my feed. I focus more on  my ["sensing machine"](https://www.onyszko.com/sensing-machine/) than on the content itself. At the moment, it comes from:

- Fine-tuning people I follow on Twitter /  LinkedIn -> if you will tune out all the people making the noise, it  is an incredible source of information and references. Especially  Twitter.
- I add to my list people from different fields  not related to what I'm doing in life to broader my circle of interest  and expose myself to those topics.
- Check few sites which add information on a  specific topic or general news. The trick is to not spend all the time  hitting "refresh" but to glance it for interesting picks and, again,  save it for later. I'm reviewing those once a day or even less  frequently. Links I'm interested in lands in Obisidian daily note. 
- Subscribe to newsletters from people who write  good things and sometimes from vendors - for example, I'm subscribed to  few newsletters from Microsoft. I do not always read them in full,  rather scan them and decide if it is interesting. If not -> hit  delete. if yes -> scan it, pick important things, save them to check  them later. 
- I save things to read/watch in Obsidian and then going through them in a free moment using its search function. 
- Last but not least, every couple of months, I  remove people from the list I observe. I remove people right away if  they are becoming annoying or share some FUD but deliberately adjust  regularly.
- I avoid having many browser tabs open and  failing to watch binge on YT videos when I see them. Rather store in  Obsidian and then get back to them. 
- I try to keep up with notes in my Obsidian vault to highlight things I find helpful or thoughts (same with books).  Always a bit behind with it, and my flow here needs to improve a bit.

Do I always get back to them? Nope. There are dozens of links I still keep unread, but there is no blame for it. There is too much information you can absorb, and don't even try it. Pick what you think is essential and drop all the rest. It still is more than you can process. 

**Elimination is not a wrong thing. Addition is. Think about what you can** cut **more than what you can add or spend more time acquiring information.** 



And now the sample of what I picked in the last two (last) weeks, which came to me through the inbound sensing machine.



​

### China steps into CPU Game

In one of the previous installments, I wrote about the "chips wars" -  pandemics period triggered shortage on the silicon market with vast  repercussions - from expensive GPUs to car makers being forced to stop  the production. This showed the geopolitical role of "silicon" in the  modern world. The US with Intel caught with lack of advanced abilities  and playing the catch-up game, majority of production lead by China and  Europe having none of it at all and being dependent on the rest of the  world. 

"Silicon" is necessary for us now, and here's big news: [**'Historic breakthrough': Chinese chipmaker unveils self-developed CPU architecture**](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-04-17/Chinese-company-unveils-self-developed-CPU-architecture--ZvSw4KIJq0/index.html). It is not a new "chip" in the existing world, but China has developed  its own CPU architecture and instruction set. We live in a world with  Intel and ARM dominating the CPUs world with their architectures. Now we have a new player - China, with its own distinct CPU architecture  LoongArch. As this article claims, there is also an OS developed for it: *(...) complete OS based on the "LoongArch" has also run stably on computers using the chip***,** *which has the maturity close to Windows XP (...)*.

If anyone can pull it off now, it is China with its own market and the  sphere of influence in many countries and regions. Imagine if they will  produce their own CPUs and convince African countries and people there  to adopt them and use them. 

Definitely, an interesting move and development to watch in the years to come. It  might be a flop and disappear, but it is not likely. China is playing  the long game, and being independent in this area can be their advantage in the long term game. 

Another interesting aspect of it is to observe how Open Source helped them with it and how they will use Open Source to promote it and build around it. 



### Speaking about chips - why does weather matter?

If we speak about the silicon chips, I'm still waiting for a good moment  to get back to my gaming/workstation rig plans. Still, it turns out the  weather change might disrupt it, or I should stop waiting: [Why the world should pay attention to Taiwan's drought](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56798308)

What wheatear has in common with silicon production? Taiwan is experiencing a drought, and it forces industry there to limit the intake of water.  What industry is located in Taiwan? You are right. It is semiconductors  manufacturing. 

It might contribute to the shortage of chips becoming even worst and lasting longer than anticipated. 



### China vs. the rest of the world - not what you think 

China is getting interesting. Not only from a technology point of view but  because they are starting to divert from the way we (as a Western  society) think about the world and how it should run. It takes years to  prove what is working. Still, China recently started to do things, which from Western society, are not reasonable. Still, if you stop thinking  in "Me" terms and switch to "We" thinking, it might make more sense. 

In a recent move, **[China Bans For-Profit School Tutoring in Sweeping Overhaul](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-24/china-bans-school-curriculum-tutoring-firms-from-going-public).** Why does it matter? 

In Western society, education is getting harder to get. It cost more to  get it, and as one of my friends called it, it is a "weapon race" for  kids' education. You want to place your kids in a good school because it increases the chance, not of good teaching (it isn't granted) but  securing more connection in the future network. 

This drives the cost of education, creates private schools with skyrocketing fees, and builds networks with upward mobility trend not based on merit but on wealth. 

Here China does something different. This move tries to stop the process of  education becoming an industry and accessible only to the wealthy and  make it more accessible to the general population. They are doing it,  even for a cost of immediate harm to their economy and companies who  builds their business model on it.

Will it work? Is it a better approach than building a business with tuition  fees and students debts? I don't know. Those are bets society is making  (or people at the power in the community), and we will be observing the  result of these bets in the years to come. Definitely worth watching.



### Privacy is getting harder - Apple starts to scan images on your phone.

I'm a privacy advocate, and I care about it in my daily life as much as I can. *"I don't have anything to hide"* as a lie on the Internet is pretty close to the "I've read and understood Terms & Conditions" agreement ([if you haven't watch Mikko's talk about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKe-aO44R7k)).

My personal approach evolved over the years, and I don't try to maintain  total privacy. That would mean cutting myself off the Internet and most  typical activities nowadays, including shopping. It is about choices of  what you do, use, and your behaviors. 

You are using or not end-to-end encryption often at the moment: WhatsApp,  iMessage, Facebook - all those messaging apps use it. What makes it more complex? It makes life harder for all the agencies tracking "bad  behaviors" and those snooping at it.

Apple dropped the news that they deploy a new tool to help fight child pornography: [**Apple's Plan to "Think Different" About Encryption Opens a Backdoor to Your Private Life**](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life). In a nutshell, they deploy tech on the phone to scan images before  being encrypted locally on your device. If something suspicious will  happen, they will take action to notify the authorities. 

Is it bad? Not in its intent, and it is fighting a real problem. I thought about it myself some time ago that technology like this could help us  protect kids from strangers (note to myself: write about it).

Where's the problem? It makes a dent and makes it tempting to try to use it for other use cases. It is based on signatures dropped by Apple, so why not push them, to add something else to the detection mechanism for  commercial or political reasons. Or why not start to detect what you  type, speak or scan your camera to know what you do. 

It might not be that important for you depends where you live, but in some places of the world, agencies and governments will for sure try to push Apple to abuse it. 

I'm still planning to use iPhone. The reason I'm using it is also one of my choices about digital safety and privacy. For a while now, I'm  switching my comms to Signal. It will be interesting to observe if and  how Apple will force apps like Signal to allow such scanning and respond to it.



### The Internet is rotting! 

What? It isn't a tomato. As a fact - the Internet is rotting in the mass of  the links and information produced. Internet is based on the connection  between sites and information pieces, and those links are not persistent forever. Companies die, and domains are being abandoned. Linked content disappears. That's a natural process, but what is the scale of it? 

The study described in ["What the ephemerality of the Web means for your hyperlinks"](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/linkrot-content-drift-new-york-times.php) gives some hints. Researches reviewed over 0.5M of articles in the New  York Times with over 2M links. Out of those links in total, ~25% is gone and goes to nothing, being also a possible target to be replaced with  some other content. The rate increases in time, with over ~70% of links  dated to 1998 (yes, the Internet is old enough) being gone. 

​                      [ ![What the ephemerality of the Web means for your hyperlinks](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/922c02574db0b46a95b1d8a207073712cc95404f.webp) ](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/linkrot-content-drift-new-york-times.php)                    



If you are in the SEO world, it is not news for you. In SEO, it is common  to look for links that are gone on sites like NYT and replace them with  your own content. People use it also to "hack" sites and display adult  content on authoritative sites using expired domain takeover. 

Is it a problem that will kill us? Nope, but it is interesting to observe  and one which affects information people consume over time. Once legit  article with information now might be replaced with dis-information,  people will not see a difference. 



### Speaking about disinformation

How many people are needed to spread some news on the Internet? It turns out the number is TWELVE. Study shows that ["Just 12 People Are Behind Most Vaccine Hoaxes On Social Media, Research Shows"](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/13/996570855/disinformation-dozen-test-facebooks-twitters-ability-to-curb-vaccine-hoaxes). 

That's not a lot. I point it out not to start the discussion about vaccines  (your personal choice), but because it shows how easy it is right now to amplify something. The scale of the Internet and people using it lets  individuals (or organizations) boost news or a product to a global  scale. It is a dangerous combination with a lack of transparency [on who is being paid to tell what on the Internet](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-57928647.amp).

You can use it to sell products and generate business, but you can also  spread a hoax, misinformation, and hate. As with every tool - people  find a way to use and abuse it.

Getting back on track with writing, blogging, and podcasting. Right after I hit "Send Later" on this newsletter, I'm recording a new podcast episode  (in Polish, you can find it here). If you can follow me in Polish, stay  tuned for it. The English version of the podcast is in the making - it  still needs some time to be revealed.
