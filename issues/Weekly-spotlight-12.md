# Friday's spotlight #12

 ## Are we killing free access for resources? Role of the future. A gem! Guide for consultants ... and more



---



I'm glad to be here with you next Friday. The last few e-mails were a bit  packed and dense, so this one is in on a little lighter note. I decided  to share some thinking about the future, which is going on in my head.  As a usual couple of links and things, I found worthy my attention this  week. 

Some of those links today **are real gems**, so make sure to check those. With that, let's dive into Friday's spotlight #12 - enjoy!

*If you like my Friday's e-mail want to send this to a friend so they can get these emails too,[ here's the link](https://signup.onyszko.com/). I**t would also make my day if you shared this newsletter on Twitter.

### ﻿**Food for thoughts:** Are we killing it? 

Here's a bit on future technology trends and what bothers me for a couple of weeks, and I need to tap your brains on this one. 

With current trends around technology, including crypto and other new areas**: Are we killing free access to the Web?**

Most likely, I'm wrong on it; observing some trends made me think about how  it will develop. So here's a thing and my line of thinking around it. 

Like it or not, it seems we are in the next paradigm shift for many things.  We had a couple of them in the last 20+ years. First around 2000s with  Internet economy boom and bust. 2000's Internet bubble basted, but it  gave away to the new economy and gave us a new set of companies and an  entire startup ecosystem. In the end, it paves the path for Amazon and  similar companies, building cloud computing, establishing social  networks, gig economy, and all other things we take now for granted (and which were not here ten years ago). 

Now we see another shift accelerated through the pandemic situation.  Pandemic itself has not caused it; it was a catalyst for speeding up in  many areas. Major trends which long term will come out if it (in my own, biased opinion) are:

- Changes in the way we work and the entire  employee-employer relationship will evolve (hint: more distributed, not  saying remote here as it is not about the place but relationship)

- Change in a customer - companies relationship  and how we consume (hint: it will be more direct, fewer intermediates,  companies will own direct relationship with customers) 

- Changes in education - see an end of formal education requirements and education transformation in many areas. 

From a technology perspective, what seems to drive this change is everything called "crypto." Still, it is misleading to think only about things  such as cryptocurrencies or finances. It is an new wave of thinking and  building with those relationships I mentioned above in mind. It includes consumer behaviors, the use of ML in everyday tasks, the way we will  learn and live, how we will use identity online and what it will enable. 

What is a short-term threat I'm observing?  It is affecting the availability of services and computing for people who are entering the market. Few  examples:

- The rise in cryptocurrencies and pandemics  supply chain disruption caused a spike in prices and availability of  computers. It seems that troubles will continue across 2022, and if the  value of the crypto market will rise, prices will still be high.
- The rise in crypto prices gave incentive for  people to abuse free services offered by vendors for developers. Result - a lot of companies are limiting free offerings. Here's a couple of  references in this area:
  - [Crypto-mining gangs are running amok on free cloud computing platforms](https://therecord.media/crypto-mining-gangs-are-running-amok-on-free-cloud-computing-platforms/).
  - [Cryptocurrency is an abject disaster.](https://drewdevault.com/2021/04/26/Cryptocurrency-is-a-disaster.html) 
- Because of the demand for computing power, the  prices of servers in places like OVH and Rackspace are going up even 5x. Those vendors need to limit SSD drives in machines even for legit  customers because those are killed for CHIA mining. 

Weak signals, but if it continues, it will limit the accessibility of  industry for new people. On the other side of the equation, new projects are often created around capturing this new economy with coins and  tokens in mind before the value creation for users. 
There are also  movements to tie Open Source development with token economy and sustain  Open Source development. One example of such a platform is [GitCoin](https://gitcoin.co/), but all projects without it will have trouble attracting talents to work if this will be a new model. 

I'm not saying the sky is falling on our heads, but we also need to do a  bit of critical thinking - what might go wrong with it? I do not see a  lot of it. 

I'm might be plain wrong, and there is none to my worries. For example, **[one of the 13-year-old developers who thrive in this new environment paints a brighter future](https://twitter.com/Covalent_HQ/status/1395467067466289154).** 

The question is - will this future be as it is promised more distributed. 

I'm not so sure about it, but time will tell. As you can see from this  thread, sometimes my head wonders in strange territories, but we need it to innovate and develop new ideas :). 

What is your take on it? Any thoughts?

### Bookmark's spotlight 

There's more during the week which I can cram here, so it sometimes comes down  to tough choices to not overload this one, and here's my information  bubble from this week.



﻿**Is Value Stream Architect your next career opportunity?** 

I get asked very often what might be the next "big" thing or what to  learn. The honest answer is "I don't know", but my sensing machine  sometimes gets a hint on some areas and directions. Here's one which  resonates with me - would you want to be a Value Stream Architect? Who  is a Value Stream Architect: 

﻿*The Value Stream Architect is an influencer, a consultant, an optimizer, and an architect**.* *They work* *closely* *with a Product Owner, who is* *primarily* *responsible for the funding and prioritizing of all the work undertaken by the  product team (features, defects, risk, and debts) to optimize the  business value, quality, cost, and happiness of the team supporting the  entire product lifecycle**.* 

This article - **[The Age of Software Needs Value Stream Architects ](https://drewdevault.com/2021/04/26/Cryptocurrency-is-a-disaster.html)**- paints a picture of such a role. It is a perfect career option and path that will build with more businesses going into technology. Is it the  next role for you?



﻿**The Strategic Independent**

Here's a real gem I stumbled upon this week - a book online: **[The Strategic Independent, Theory & Practice for Independent Consultants](https://tomcritchlow.com/strategy/)**. 

It is a series of our chapter online, and it is **A MUST READ** if you want to go independent. Even if you are employed, you are a  developer or consultant working with customers - read it. It will give  you great insights, strategies, and tactics which you can also use  within the organization + an understanding of the process. 

I started from the middle with those two:

- [The Consultant's Grain: Why (their) culture eats (your) strategy for breakfast](https://tomcritchlow.com/2017/07/18/the-consultants-grain/)

- [Optimism as an Operating System: Yes! And... part 2](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/)

Great read and insight are on consultant's mindset and reality.



﻿**What do your phone moves tell about you?** 

Every phone now has this little device called an accelerometer (plus a couple of others). Have you ever wondered what it can tell you? Did you know  that man carries a phone differently from a woman, and you can say it  using an accelerometer? This example is not from the source I will link  here, but here is an exciting whitepaper on it - [Privacy Implications of Accelerometer Data: A Review of Possible Inferences](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3309074.3309076).

​                      [ ![Privacy Implications of Accelerometer Data: A Review of Possible Inferences](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/9464efcce11930e083e85f22179512b0ed6bf837.png) ](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3309074.3309076)                    

If you don't want to go through the entire whitepaper (which is  interesting), peek at the section with a graph of data you can get from  your accelerometer and what it tells about you—pretty freaking scary :).



﻿**Time for a new search?** 

What is one of the tasks you do every day, and by now, you treat it as a  digital version of "breathing"? Search. We do search a lot, and we  accepted Google box as a default way of doing it. Can it be done better? 

If you haven't got it already from my writings, I'm pretty skeptical about how far current "AI" can take us. Still, there are tasks where it  shines if you accept an ML good at those tasks. This article from MIT  Review - **[Language models like GPT-3 could herald a new type of search engine](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/14/1024918/language-models-gpt3-search-engine-google/)** - paints a picture of the different way we can search. 

Models like GPT-3 are good at text processing, and searching is a task, which  can enjoy this approach. Of curse, there is a risk of falling into some  bubble based on these algorithms, but if you haven't realized, you are  most likely in your search bubble already (think about it)/ 

Personalized streams of data supported by ML tools are IMO something that will  realize in our interfaces and devices in a couple of years. We need  better filtering to stay sane.



### Tool's spotlight 

​                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)                                                                                            

This week I did a bit of geeky things and beefed up my[ terminal with **oh-my-posh**.](https://ohmyposh.dev/) It isn't a tool that solves life-threatening issues, but I like the aesthetics it adds to the terminal. Check it out. 

I got a hint of it from Scott Hanselman's tweet. If you don't know Scott  yet, even if you are not in Microsoft space, it is a person worth  following and reading. Not only on Twitter, [here's his blog, and you will find all the links there](https://www.hanselman.com/).

A couple of times, I mentioned Obisidian or Roam Research as a tool to  capture the knowledge. Here's an article from the No Kill Switch blog by Sebastian Gebski where he describes how he is using Obisidian to build  his knowledge capturing tool - **[How building a DSL has helped me organize my work](https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/how-building-a-dsl-has-helped-me-organize-my-work/)**. 

If you are among my Polish readers, I **[spoke with Sebastian some time ago on my podcast](https://share.transistor.fm/s/fd1f1aa3)**. It's a pretty exciting and funny discussion - I enjoyed it very much  and made sure you listen to it. It is worth it. Sebastian is an  experienced and knowledgeable person. 

﻿*PS.* *I build all the notes and ideas around this newsletter in those tools (Obsidian / RoamResearch*)

That's all I got for you this week. I hope it will give you something to think about and read over a weekend and upcoming week.
