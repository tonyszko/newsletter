# Weekly spotlight #23 

## Role of long-term thinking, dealing with procrastination, evolution and GitHub spaces and more 



---



Hi

Welcome to the next installment of Weekly spotlight (former Friday's  spotlight); again, a bit later than usual Friday, but here it is.  Without fail. 



## **Long-term thinking** 

The Intro section of this e-mail exposes you to things which occupy my mind in recent weeks. Sometimes it is more practical than observing behavior (my own or people around me) or the environment. 

This one is on a later kind. I talked with people around me, and it made me  think about a factor that contributes to good life and success (if you  want to call it this way) and the well-being of all of us. 

If you want to create something, lead a good and enjoyable life, you need to apply long-term thinking towards this goal. 

Long-term thinking is hard for us all. Why you should drop what you are doing  right now for uncertain reward a couple of years from now. Why should  you run (swim, do any form of activity) now? It is known to decrease the chance (not avoid it as there is nothing sure) of possible cardiac  arrest in the future. But you are here now, and it is painful and takes  your time. 

***Where's the reward for all your effort?\*** 

Everything around us tells us to focus on short-term gains and results, where  long-term gains and results are what matters and where the actual gain  is. 

Thinking long-term is hard. You need to convince yourself now to think about the possible (not given) future and that you may benefit from the current  activity in the future. Another example is planning ahead of time and  executing steps to complete it, with future outcomes years ahead of you. 

It makes things like losing weight or saving for retirement hard. That's  why many people don't start it or fail initially, as the results are not there or are minimal in the short run. It is especially true in  financial planning and savings, where you plan for a possible future 30  or 40 years from now. 

​                      [ ![Long term effort by Taylor Simpson](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/e78b0eee84a27f974a32259c733b88574573a6f4.jpeg) ](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)                    

Long-term thinking at the individual level is hard. Long-term thinking at the  group level is like another dimension of being hard. 

I had a recent discussion with a friend over dinner about global warming  and its possible outcomes. Regardless of what you (or I) think about it, it is an exemplification of a problem with long term thinking:

- You need to think about possible consequences (or lack of such) tens of years ahead of you. 
- You need to think not about yourself but about the people who might not even be on the planet and are strange to you.
- You need to think about the possible events (or lack of such) which are not local, and you might not experience that firsthand.

It sounds like a tough job to convince someone to think about it all if  they cannot sort out their financial planning to save for retirement in  the first place. 

It's not about convincing you to think about global warming, but this is an  excellent example of the problem with long-term thinking on a personal  and group level.



My observations and practical approach to it:

- I observe (anecdotal evidence) that people who  put long-term thinking to work get better results live happier, and  better prepare for the unexpected. 
- Trying to force long-term thinking on someone  fails. You need to convince yourself that it is something that works and will help you be better off. Examples are all around it, and there is  no need to produce them. 
- The biggest problem is motivation, with a lack of obvious evidence that it will work. 



What I do about it:

- I set my expectations and validation points  towards the trajectory rather than the specific goal. Taking the example of financial preparation: I observe if my net worth is on a growing  course, rather than putting particular goals to reach in an absolute  number. 
- On things that do need long-term thinking, I  don't do checks too often. Instead of checking and planning things every week, I do it once per month or once per quarter is enough. Sometimes  progress is not visible in the short term, and it makes people  demotivated. 
- I try to confirm my assumptions and change those if required on a regular but longer basis - let's say once a year. Do I work towards the future I want to live in? Does what I do contribute to it in the long run? 



Long-term thinking is with me in many areas of both my professional and private life. Simple examples:

- I do physical activities to stay healthy for a  longer period (not granted), running and adding different activities  (swimming, biking, strengths training - this one is planned) now and  then. 
- I do financial planning towards the future to  secure myself when I am not able or willing to work. It influences many  decisions I make towards current spending. 
- I do regular health checks, as it increases (not eliminates completely) the chance of catching some problem early when  it occurs.
- I do spend time reading and researching things  to increase my chance to have a promising, professional career longer in the future in various fields (even if I don't know what it exactly will be in 10-20 yrs from now)
- I maintain my activities around blog / social  media / this newsletter even if I don't need them right now. It helps me sharpen my saw and requires going outside of my daily "bubble." 



﻿Those are simple examples of long-term thinking in action. It doesn't have to be something drastic or fancy. It is a deliberate process of thinking  ahead and asking yourself questions about your desired future self, and  acting for it, even if it is not granted. Progress is hard to make or  measure in a short period. 

**Long-term thinking and acting with it in mind is the key to calm and successful  (I need to research another word for it :) ) life on your own terms.** 

What are your long-term thinking areas and examples from your personal or  professional life? If you want to share it with me, reply with it to  this address. If I get more samples, I will contribute them back to the  audience. 



Now let's check what I found in my bookmarks and notes for this week. 

​                                                                                                                                          



## Bookmark's spotlight 



**Shifting left on security**

People say that I always end up with security. Well, it is a sneak peek into  my bubble, so I'm more tuned to this kind of news, sources, and tools.  Here's one from a bit different angle. 

Here's a bit of professional career advice - if you want to position yourself  on the market for a more extended period, look at a cross-section of  cloud, development, and security. Even with changing landscape, you  can't be completely wrong on this bet. The cross-section of these  elements is still a blind spot for many and is in high demand. 

Where to start? A Google's whitepaper "[Shifting left on security: Securing software supply chain](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)" is a good starting point. It comes from Google, but it is about the  practice, so it applies to another tech stack. It will gain importance  in years to come, and few people know how to handle security in the  product delivery process. It is worth taking a look at it in search of a new professional place.

Google's docs on [DevOps capabilities](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) are a good reference point for many things, so good to place a bookmark on it. 



**How many keys do you have left?**

*"You have a finite number of keystrokes left in your hands before you die."* Use them wisely! 

When I speak with Predica team members and people outside of the company, I  often repeat to maximize the value of what you create. Think about how  long it will be valid, relevant, and instead of writing something in an  e-mail, it is better to write a blog post about it. 

Scott Hanselman put it together in a funny way: a[ quick tool to calculate how many keystrokes](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) you have left (on average) in your life. Why? Because you may want to  maximize the impact of each keystroke and how many people it will reach. 

Quoting the tool web page:

*When you e-mail someone, you are giving them not only the gift of your  attention but also your limited remaining keystrokes. If you e-mail  someone one on one, you're reaching that one person.*

*Rather than answering every e-mail, consider blogging the answer and e-mailing them the link to your post. A knowledge base or wiki would be a better  place for your work to live. Assuming you want your message to reach as  many people as possible, blog it, don't e-mail it.*

If you need encouragement to start putting your words out there, this is a good reason. Maximize the value of your keystroke! 

Don't you know what is your words-per-minute count (WPM)? Here's a tool to help you check that - [Typing Speed Test](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/). BTW - it is an excellent example of marketing tactics from LiveChat which put this tool together. 

​                      [ ![My typing speed](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/a81a3563f7535452678d922c2707f249457c2507.jpeg) ](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)                    

Based on this, my remaining keystroke is: 

​                      [ ![My keystrokes left](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/c83dab36fab2fadfdfdc775f041a9da9001b51b9.jpeg) ](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)                    

Some of it will land in your inboxes - that's my keystroke gift for you :). 



**On the Edge**

I like podcast recording because I have a chance to talk with people and  receive a gift of their time and knowledge. It also leads to the  discovery of new tools, books, and places. 

Recording one of the latest episodes I've learned about "[Edge](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)." This site contains recordings of talks and discussions with various  people on different subjects. Those are not random people but  scientists, entrepreneurs, and experts in their fields. All at your  disposal, recorded, and available for free. 

Consider it as an alternative to the next Netflix binge session (nothing wrong  with Netflix if you enjoy it). I like the idea and content and found it  very interesting. 



**Dealing with procrastination**

I can procrastinate for days. Believe me. If it doesn't look like it from the outside, that's because I'm good at hiding it. It is why I've  created my own "[Simple decision-making framework for everyday use](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)." 

Krzysztof Daniel wrote a post about procrastination - "[My three-step recipe for overcoming procrastination](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)." Is procrastination hunting you? If yes, it will resonate with you and help you avoid it when it creeps in. 

Not spoiling the content of the article; Krzysztof identified fear as a reason for him to procrastinate: 

*Procrastination did happen because I was afraid to fail.* 

I read another opinion which is also true in some cases - procrastination tells you that you don't want to do this thing at all. Recognizing  between this one or fear requires a bit of self-reflection. 

I still struggle with it, and I can recognize when procrastination creeps in :). Recognition not always leads to overcoming it, then such simple  frameworks become helpful. 



**How to prepare yourself for disaster?**

Here comes my security bubble again but in a different context. [Michał Zalewski (lcamtuf)](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) is a security researcher who I follow here and there online for my  entire career. He is a well-established security researcher, author, and known figure in security circles. 

Michał got back to my feed as he is publishing his next book around the topic he has well covered in his "[Disaster planning for regular folks](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)" post. You don't have to be paranoid about the future. Still, it is not  being paranoiac if you think about "what might happen" in being prepared for the unexpected. Black Swans happens, but it doesn't need a black  swan type of event to put you in a situation where 'being prepared' pays off. 

Post itself is worth reading, and I've already pre-ordered my copy of the "[Practical Doomsday](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)" book coming up in 2022. 



**Apple's move on fighting child abuse sparks whole new discussions around security**.

The previous week I wrote about new features introduced by Apple to fight  child abuse online and protect kids out there. Short re-cap: Apple  introduces scanning technology in two distinct forms - on your device  for messages content and on the iPhoto library (if you use it) - to  detect child abuse pictures and trigger actions if necessary. 

Here are two good sources as a follow-up to this topic:

- Apple's New 'Child Safety' Initiatives, and the Slippery Slope ([LINK](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/))
- Apple's Mistake ([LINK](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/))

This new feature triggers a whole further discussion on privacy, what  companies can/should do to prevent abuse and the right of you as an  owner of a device vs. public good. This discussion will go for a long  time, and I will watch how it will develop. It is important to what  extent (currently they claim that nothing like this will happen) Apple  will be forced to follow national governments who will want to abuse  this feature (they will want to do it). 

One thing is clear from it and highlighted in those sources linked above -  doing a change is hard, and essential is a way you communicate those  changes. 



**OpenAI brings natural language as a way to do coding**.

I wrote about AI-assisted programming before - it seems OpenAI pushes it  much faster than I anticipated. Here is a blog post and demonstration of using the OpenAI Codex model to do [conversational programming for a web app using a natural language](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/). 

​                      [ ![OpenAI Codex Live Demo](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/2b6c5cfc284a247414fc324f699531f383faba3f.png/e8bdd0901abdf95525fb38d1b484591e72e229c8.png) ](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)                    

Seems that the era of computed assisted development will come much faster,  and we will learn how to use those tools to deliver code faster. 

​

## Tool's spotlight

I don't add a lot of new tools to my toolbox as it consumes time and  attention to try it out and incorporate those tools in my workflow. In  this edition, the tools section focus is on the developer tools side of  things. 

[GitHub Codespaces](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) go live, and it is another excellent example of technology evolution  patterns in action. We have come from heavy, desktop-based, and paid  IDEs as the main development environment to cloud-based, lightweight,  and free or cheap IDE in a couple of years. 10+ years ago, heavy,  desktop IDE was a way to code. During this time, we went through several iterations with various IDEs to end up with free or commercial,  cloud-based IDEs for developers. 

GitHub Codespace is a commercial tool that lets you run your development  environment in a cloud (it spins off the VM for you). Again - a  brilliant example of evolution pattern:

- Compute has moved from product (computers) to commodity (APIs)
- IDE has moved from the paid, heavy product (VS)  with the help of Open Source to adapt it to something close to commodity (VS Code)
- New tools were built on commodity compute and storage and widely adopted product + practice (DevOps, code repositories).
- Cloud-based IDEs make it easier to implement  emerging tools and practice, e.g., AI-assisted programming, into a  developer's workflow.

I mention Codespaces here, but there are plenty of other IDEs online, such as [Replit ](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)or Amazon's [Cloud9 ](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)(and many others). The barrier of tools for development is gone. Soon the  idea of downloading the IDE will be strange to people. 

Now the thing about the combination of OpenAI Codex mentioned above with  such online tools is available one click away. That's the future we are  looking at in a couple of years from now. 

The cherry on top. Piotr Stapp, a fellow MVP and developer, pointed out the brilliant feature brought with Codespaces. It lets you lunch an IDE  environment in a browser and contribute a PR on GitHub with a single  keystroke. 

​                      [ ![New GitHub feature - PIotr stapp Twitter](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/4ef4d92082be5ae58c48490df5e0891671ef65a8.jpeg) ](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)                    

Go to the repository in your browser and click "." (dot), then wait and see the magic happens.



Another development-focused tool that landed in my feed is [Sourcegraph](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/). This tool lets you search through the code repositories you own or work with. Take a look at this example of how it might be integrated with  Azure DevOps: *"[Use Sourcegraph with Azure DevOps Repos](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)."* It lands on my list of tools to check for the future and see if adoption will help develop projects.

​                                                                                                                                   

That's it for this week. I appreciate your attention spent on this e-mail.  This one is loaded. It always is a question, make it shorter to the  point, very dense or add some of my thoughts on the subject even if it  makes it a little longer. 


**What's your take on it?** 

All the replies go straight into my Inbox, and they will be replied to. If  you have any questions, comments, or suggestions on what you want to see covered, shoot me an e-mail.

Till the next one.
