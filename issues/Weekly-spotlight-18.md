# Friday's spotlight #18 

## Two skills you need to master as a consultant (or any other profession) to make you stand out.



---



When writing my last e-mail, I wasn't aware that I would have a chance to  put my bits of advice in practice so soon and practice stoics virtues in daily life. 

My return flight got pushed a couple of days forward, and I had to stay  abroad a couple of days longer. You can imagine it required a couple of  things to be re-arranged: 



One of the impacts was that I couldn't prepare an e-mail for Friday, so ... here it is on Monday :). 

To remind you of last week: you can't control things that had happened; you can control how you approach them. 

The flight was delayed, and I can't change it. Can I be angry? Yes. Was I?  For a moment but not for a flight but for crappy customer service, which wasted four hours of my time with no result. 

Instead of being angry about it, I contacted our friends who happened to be in  the same country, booked a place to stay next to them, extended the car  rental, and enjoyed a couple of days more holidays in a friendly company and new location. A situation that causes many frustrations for many  turned out to be a pleasant experience with friends in sunny weather. 

(I know I'm privileged in many ways to be able to afford it and work in an environment that allowed me to do it - be remote and flexible  arrangement at work. I'm always great full for it is such a situation). 

To summarize this thread - practice this approach every day by a bit. Over time it will let you be more calm and happy. Here's a great list I put  in my out of office message for e-mail account:

(...) 

- Focus on what you can control 
- Reduce your wants 
- Read philosophy every day 
- Ignore the inessential 
- Don't compare yourself to others 
- Live as if you've died and come back to life (bonus time) 
- Do good to feel good

(...)

That led my thoughts to two crucial things for every person interacting with clients, be it a sales, technical or support person. This Friday's  spotlight (Monday, summer edition) will share my approach to managing  expectations. 

### Minimize the uncertainty and live a happy professional life 

My philosophy about being a consultant and providing services to others:  People live in the function of minimizing uncertainty. Saying simple,  people do not like to be surprised. 

Every time you do something within a team, working with an internal client or external client, you are doing two things: you make some commitment (*I will do something, I will check it, it will be solved*) and create an expectation (*it will be done by Wednesday, I will handle it after I will do the other thing, I will return to you in 1 hour*).

What you control are your commitment and the expectations you set on it.  What you don't own is other people's commitments they make based on your pledge (in the form of a promise or planning the work) and the  expectations they create based on it. 

The best way to be seen as a professional is to always keep your  commitments within the expectations you said. Fairy tale. Promised land  of consulting and services. But you know what ... **THINGS HAPPENS.** 

One of my friends once said: *I love deadlines; they make the excellent whooshy sound when they fly by.* 

THINGS HAPPENS. Flight might get delayed. There might be an emergency that  pulls you out of the flow, and you need to put the fire out (at Predica, we have a "Support first" policy, work required to put out the customer fire goes first before planned work). Those are things out of your  control; they might also be enforced on you by authority or  circumstances. 

Here comes uncertainty. Other people making their commitment based on yours  don't know about it and often don't have to know about it. What they  need is to remove uncertainty from their workflow.

Assuming something like this had happened and you know that you will be delayed  with tasks you promised to deliver, there are two ways to do it:

- **Wait until the deadline will pas**s and the person you promised to return with it will ask you about its status. 
- **Let them know that something had happened and it will be delayed by** ... and here you set next expectation or clearly says that because of  what is happening you can tell it right now, but you will get back to  with new deadline by X. 

The first case is the worst situation you can be in. You are late, you  haven't told the person who is waiting for a result about it, and now  you need to apologize and explain that you are late. Other people set  their commitment based on yours, and they need to explain to others that they will be late. You don't want it. 

My professional life taught me that if you remove uncertainty and let  people know up front that you will be late and deliver it on another  day, they will not be angry. Typically they will smile and say, "OK, it  happens; thank you for letting me know." Why? Because you limit the  uncertainty in their life. They can manage it. 

**People operate in the function of limiting uncertainty in their life.** 

Remember about it, and it will make your life easier:

- Set expectations you can live up to 
- Things happen; factor it in your expectations. 
- When things happen, communicate them early and  manage other people's expectations. Remember, they made a commitment  based on your commitment to them. 
- Communicate early and clearly about the change.  Do not wait until the last moment. The worst situation is when the  receiving person will ask you about "status," and you must apologize and set new expectations under pressure. 

A simple thing, often forgotten and mismanaged. It applies to tasks,  e-mail responses you promised, decisions you vowed to make, personal  commitments. 

And the second thing to remember and go with it is ... customer experience. 

### People remember the experience, not deliverable. 

I started to observe and ask people who are delivering great work about  their background. What I found is that often best consultants have  experience in some "customer-facing" role. It might be early on or later in a career. It might be help-desk line, waiter summer job, being a  sales clerk at the store. 

Those things share because it puts them face-to-face with the customer and  their problems and teaches them how to handle the customer experience.

Think about it? What is the most pleasant experience you remember about  shopping, a restaurant, taking a haircut or going on holiday? Is it  connected with the product you bought, the food is tasty, or the most  fabulous haircut in your lifetime? 

Most likely, it is not. The product you bought failed later, the food was  great, but maybe even average, and the haircut was the same as always.  What makes those things to remember is an experience you got from the  person who delivered it or the way it was delivered (for example,  packaging the product or coffee at the barbershop). 

**CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE MATTERS!** 

I was reminded of it with my last holiday's adventure of changed flights. Flight changes happen all the time. I remember when I had a flight  canceled in the middle of the night (literally at Midnight) in the  United States a night before my return flight. I got an SMS that might  return flight is canceled, I looked at it, and I went back to sleep. 

Why? 

Because the following SMS was from my travel agent who said: "We are already on it, go to sleep, in the morning you will have a new flight." And I did. What I did when I couldn't reach my airline about this latest flight  change for a full day? I asked my friendly travel agent to help. They  could drop me as I bought my tickets directly, but instead, I had a  person from this agency on a call in 5 minutes, and after 15 minutes, my agent had all things sorted out. 

Will I use them again? Sure as hell I will! 

Will I fly with this airline again? Practically - probably yes, but I will try to avoid it. 

The way you will communicate, deliver your work, and handle your customer  experience internally and externally has a significant impact. Sometimes more remarkable than the work you provide. People will value the work  you delivered, and they will remember its quality, but long term, they  will remember the experience of working with you. 

The experience they got from you as customers will decide if they will work with you again or not more than your delivery. 

Those simple things will make a massive impact on your career over a long  period. I had this experience in my professional career at Microsoft  when my senior colleague [Krzysztof Skubis](https://skris.pl/) grabbed me for coffee and told me: "You are doing brilliant work, and  people know it, but if you do not change this, people will not want to  work with you." 

You can guess what "this" was by now? Yes, it was about my communication  and creating uncertainty for people with things I delivered. I like to  think I improved a bit on it over time. However, the fact that you are  getting this e-mail on Monday might not be proof of work for it. 

It's always a work in progress. 

What you can add to the Daily stoic's list from the beginning of this e-mail now is:

- **Manage and remove uncertainty from people life** 
- **The value customer experience you deliver and you receive (it is important to value people who provide it to you)**

See you on Friday on the next installment of Friday's spotlight. This time I will have some extra resources for you besides my stream of  consciousness. 

Have a great week. 

As always, questions, comments, inspirations are welcome. Hit reply and  write to me. I see a bit of uptake in e-mails from you, and it puts a  smile on my face.
