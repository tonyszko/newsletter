##  Survivorship bias around us, future of degrees, serverless or distributed and more



---



Hi

 

It is interesting to observe how simple facts are making us feel and  create a different space. Take this newsletter.  I could delegate  research around it and also copy-writing for it base on my notes. I  could have content for it written weeks ahead (a good plan anyway). 

I don't. Why? 

There is something in the freedom of picking the topic, which speaks to me  when I sit on Friday morning before everyone else at home will wake up,  and I start with a "blank page." If you were wondering if I know in  advance what I will write about - no. I don't. I have some ideas and  notes from the last weeks and sometimes notes on a more general topic,  but I start with an open page and question: what I want to pass to  others? 

Here is what was fresh on my mind this week. 

***Technical note:** I've changed source e-mail address for this newsletter. If you use any rule to put it in correct folder please update it to [tomek@onyszko.com.](mailto:tomek@onyszko.com.) Sorry for inconvenience.* 

### Survivorship bias around us

I see, and I get many newsletters to provide quick, actionable items and  tips to put in place right here and now. I'm not sure I will ever follow this direction, as I think there are many of those already. Too much of it actually and creates information overhead for us. Too many things to try and juggle. Too many directions to try and see if it will improve  something. 

More I observe it, what matters is steady effort applied over a long period  and patience. Too many people try to find this hack to achieve something faster and with fewer efforts. Some do. In those cases, we (as a  society) underestimate the role of luck and circumstances and how  repeatable and sustainable their model is. 

Yet, if something like this happens, somebody gets quick and visible  success, (s)he gets all the attention and noise of media. People start  to replicate those personal habits in sleeping, going to the gym,  investing, tools - searching for a magic clue that will let them repeat  the same success. 

Have you heard about Survivorship bias? If not -[ read about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias). In short: when looking for a clue, we often are looking at evidence in  front of us instead of looking at that evidence that is not.

We are seeing a lot of "Survivorship bias" in information around us.  Fundamental patterns and ideas might come from people and events, which  are not pushed by the media and are not "hot." 

Have you heard or seen an article about the daily routines of Warren Buffet?

If you haven't heard about the guy, he is pretty good at money investing.  Do you see articles covering him daily or news about his latest feat or  Tweet (I even don't know if he has a Twitter account)? 

No? You know why? 

Because for modern times, he is BORING! He applies simple ways of being patient and not using quick hacks over a long period. There are no cool tricks  to apply the next day. There is no magic silver bullet or quick fix he  applies to be transferred to other's life through the means of the  procedure, tools, or quick hacks. 

It is BORING! An extended period, constant and focused effort. 

It doesn't sell well in a news title or "TEN TOP LIFE TIPS" kind of style  article or a guide book.  All in all, simplicity wins over a long-term  time. Still, simplicity does not generate attention and quick revenue  right now, so it is BORING. 

Boring things doesn't have to be wrong, and it lets you focus on something  over a long time. Focus and effort applied over a long period win in the long term, but people have trouble thinking long term. Many people,  media, tools, and habits create a sense of urgency to distract you. Be  cautious about it. 



B**e aware of Survivorship bias and ask "what I do not see" more often.**

**Getting a degree - will you do it in the future?** 

We are in exciting times now when it comes to education. Why? If I would  be entering my university time right now, I'm not sure if I would take  the same path and spend five years studying. I would most likely divide  it into a shorter period split by getting real-world experience through  traveling and work. 

Why? I still think formal education has a reason and benefits in laying down the groundwork in thinking and the way you educate. Still, it does not  keep up with the pace of change and education needed in the current  world. I see it based on candidates streaming into my company; I see it  through the lens of my kids' education but also changes on the market. 

[Here is an interesting thread by Corey Quinn](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1387937035382452230) on the value of education if you also consider the time spent on it and what it can give you:



​                      [ ![So I want to talk a bit tonight about college degrees.](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/f98a780b4441f5637c52624dd10dcc09970c9936.png) ](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1387937035382452230)                    

For example, I considered if I should do extra study or degree more on a  business side (something like MBA). I've decided it is not worth it if  you consider time effort and how it prepares you for the environment  around you. Why? Because it prepares you and learn skills of the past,  and there are better ways to get some knowledge in a faster time. 

Why was it and still is important in some areas? Because it is a status  gate and signaling for a specific job. It would help if you had it to be in the network, but the actual value is diminishing or already  non-existent. 

Education will be one of the areas undergoing a significant shift in upcoming  years. I don't know yet what direction it will take. If I think about my kids 10-yrs from now, I'm not sure if I will tell them to get a degree. 



**What serverless computing it and should become: The Next Phase of Cloud Computing**

I'm a big proponent of a shift towards serverless computing. If you follow  me on social media or blogs, there is a chance you've heard that  already. I'm not advocating particular technology as Function or Lambda. Still, a general approach to build applications in a way, which  consumes resources only when delivering value.

It is so much different than we are doing right now. 

Here is a great article exploring the current and future state of "serverless computing": [What serverless computing it and should become: The Next Phase of Cloud Computing.](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/5/252179-what-serverless-computing-is-and-should-become/fulltext)

​                      [ ![What Serverless Computing Is and Should Become: The Next Phase of Cloud Computing](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/6b7706331bf98f6c8ffca63180ecdaab1f854136.png) ](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/5/252179-what-serverless-computing-is-and-should-become/fulltext)                    



If you are in technology or even if you are not deep into it, read it and  think about the implications for your area of business. This shift is  happening, and you might be caught off-guard, the same way as some  people did with a cloud computing wave. You would be surprised how many  people are playing catch-up games in the cloud at the moment. It is what drives the current job market in this area up and up. 



**Will it be serverless and distributed?** 

Crypto heats the minds and the wallets because of the prices and rush of  dopamine from crypto-cassino. Still, one technology trend which I keep  on my radar right now is distributed apps. Apps are the intersection of  few things:

- Data from user 
- Code executed over data. 
- Identity of a user

Getting those three things together with a shared set of distributes protocols  might be a new way of building applications that opens many  possibilities. I'm particularly interested in how it might enable users  to take control over their data and how it is used. 

Think about the new "Facebook" where you interact with people you want. Based on a standard protocol exchanging data from your stores where there is  no "company" who owns the data in the middle and decides who sees what? 

Think about a way to list your things and sell them to people over the  internet with no need to reveal personal facts about you. And also, not  getting information about the buyer and not storing it in some  intermediate company database. 

For the future, it is worth following this space with a corner of an eye  and check if and how it might impact your current industry and job. 

And if you are into development, I recommend following Nader Dabit (yes, he is in my bubble, so he surfaced once or more in this newsletter), who  is sharing quick and dense guides on how to start with development  distributed networks with a focus on Ethereum network- [The Complete Guide to Full Stack Ethereum Development - Tutorial for Beginners [2021]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0osIaAOFSE)                



**"The truth" about the crypto world** 

If you want to get a different look at how the crypto world looks like  from the inside, this thread provides a bit different picture from the  "ATH, ATH" crowd. Sobering view.

**Note-taking and information organization** 

Few times I wrote about tools like Obsidian and RoamResearch as two-way  linking of information seems the best way for me to organize my  information sink. I'm also getting questions about the means to organize information and be more productive. not be the best person to ask this  question as I keep my flow pretty simple:

- Mail for communication

- Todoist for task list 

- Obsidian / RoamResearch for note-taking

One thing I use more and more is ... pen and paper. [Here's a blog post from Gavin Ashto](https://gvnshtn.com/bujo/)n, a friend from the security community and times we worked together at  his workplace, who introduced a simple-looking scheme of keeping track  of things - [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/). 

Is it a silver bullet? I don't know, but you may try it out. I do some version of it on my Todos / Obsidian flow. 

​                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)                                                                                            

That's all in this week folks. No books, no new tools but still I hope you  enjoyed it and and you will find something for you in all of it. 


As always, your feedback is what makes it better and conversation with you on e-mail are what drives a lot of it and brings me joy. 


Keep both of them flowing!
