**Hi my friend** 

Next week passed by, and it is time for another Friday's spotlight. 

If you are new to this list - welcome; this is an e-mail that brings short notes on last week, links, findings, thoughts. I hope you will enjoy  it. 

This week I owe you an apology. You should get a regular, bi-weekly e-mail  to your Inbox. Life is full of surprises, and this week I had to take  care of some unexpected (everything OK, thank you for asking) things in  my personal life. The result - it wasn't sent on Tuesday. 


The good news, you will get it next Tuesday, and we are back to the rhythm. Now let's go to our Friday's spotlight.

 

​                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)                                                                                            

## ﻿﻿**## Bookmarks spotlight**


This week there were a lot of things that caught my attention. Let's try to put them indigestible order. 

﻿﻿**"AI" getting smarter**
I'm not deep in AI, but I try to follow this area's development, especially around efforts to develop more general algorithms. This one is  fascinating - *[Multimodal Neurons in Artificial Neural Networks](https://openai.com/blog/multimodal-neurons/)*. Why interesting? So far, those algorithms could recognize shapes in a  single medium - be it images or video. This paper describes the  approach. 

﻿﻿﻿The algorithm can identify an apple regardless of whether it is an apple on the image in video or a text saying "apple." Impressive as it develops  into more advanced cases. Yet it still remains a lot of work because, as you can see below, apple with "iPod" writing on it becomes "iPod."

### Career

What defines a good engineer? Some time ago, there was a thread on 10X  engineer, which showed not a great engineer. Here is a two-article  series trying to dissect what forms a great engineer. Skills are there,  but it is not enough


Read "What in the World Is World-Class Engineering?" - *[Part 1](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/what-in-the-world-is-world-class-engineering-de966cdf7c0d)* and *[Part 2](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/what-in-the-world-is-world-class-engineering-part-2-4b384c74dc19)*. I've found it fascinating. You can use it to think about your career (if it happens to be an engineer but not only). 

### Tech and Salaries

I thought if to include this one. In the end, I decided to put it here.   Here's a good article on a tech job market and how the global market  influences salaries and money available in this career - *[The Trimodal Nature of Software Engineering Salaries in the Netherlands and Europe](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/)*.

​                      [             ![Salaries areas in tech and competitions levels](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/1710f6b2d688032704ab747052fca5c142c2c229.png)           ](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/)                    

Let's say it - if you are in tech right now, you are privileged! Often, you  might be even more privileged than you think. The tech market becomes  global, and the COVID pandemic will speed up it even more. The salaries  might reach level people in other areas might not even dream of. 

Is it good? Is it bad? One effect might be that the tech industry might  become de-attached from local reality. That would be definitely bad for  society. 

Your thoughts about it?



﻿﻿**NFTs madness - critical voice**

Have you heard about NFTs and the madness around it? If not - shortest form: NFTs are digital tokens proving your rights' uniqueness to a specific,  digital thing. It confirms that the person who owns this token owns this picture, image, or tweet (yeah, I know). *[NFTs madness fires up people's imagination with sums up to $69M paid for a single digital art piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html?referringSource=articleShare).* 


Here is a bit more critical voice around NFTs from Seth Godin - *[NFTs are a dangerous trap](https://seths.blog/2021/03/nfts-are-a-dangerous-trap/)*. In all the madness, it is always good to read some critical voice. 



﻿﻿﻿**Amazon tests its own digital money.**

Speaking about crypto, *[Amazon is testing its own digital coin in Mexico](https://www.coindesk.com/amazon-digital-currency-mexico).* One of the world's largest tech companies is trying its own currency - that might become interesting.

﻿﻿**What can go wrong?!** 

I will write my thoughts around in one of the next newsletters. 



​                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)                                                                                            

## ﻿﻿**## Technology spotlight**

Single news was a bit under the radar but might have a massive impact on the  market as we know it. It is a good chance that we all use mobile phones  (who is not using them). Let's face it, right now, it is a choice of iOS or Android (in one of its versions and forks). With iOS especially but  also with Android comes an app store. We all are using it. 

App Store is a model, which allows Apple and Google to keep their app  developers in a hard grip. If you want to take advantage of mobile  phones' user base, you need to pay 30% (or more) for access to this  market. 

A Fortnite's (if you don't know it, it is a hit battle royal game)  developer, Epic, decided to challenge Apple on its home turf. They  introduced their own payment system in the game on iOS. Apple's response was swift and hard - Epic was cut off from the iOS and macOS platforms  both on Fortnite and its Unreal engine. It was a blow.

Two weeks ago, in Arizona, a *[bill was passed, which forces OS makers like Google and Apple to allow developers like Epic to bypass their payment systems. ](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation)*

Why is it important? It is a single state, but if it spreads in other  places, it will change the iOS and Google marketplace, and we will end  up with some new models. 

Will it happen? How will it look? I don't know, but it is an exciting  development in the technology world and fights for a lot of $$$ between  developers and a platform. 

Epic plays a good guy here.

## ﻿﻿**## Person spotlight** 

This week I want to introduce to you, [Ray Dalio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio). Ray Dalio is a hedge fund manager and book author. I found it  fascinating about Ray Dalio because he brings very well-rounded thinking about the principles of work, life, and the world in general. Many  times my thinking goes along with his principles. 
He is also well established in his professional life building the world's largest hedge fund Bridgewater. 


I want to bring to you two of his books which present two different worlds but connected. 

The first is best know - *[Principles. Life and Work](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Life-Work-Ray-Dalio-ebook/dp/B071CTK28D)*. This book presents his philosophy of life and principles he developed on life and work across the years. 

The second is also about principles, but around economy and debt - *[Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Debt-Crises-Ray-Dalio-ebook/dp/B07GLBHM48/)*. 

This might be hard if you are not familiar with the economy's basics (you  should spend a bit on it). Before reading it, you can read his  newsletter series on LinkedIn. Start with *[The Changing World Order](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/changing-world-order-ray-dalio-1f/?trackingId=nLah5b%2FgQregcP%2BG%2Bpotpw%3D%3D)* (LinkedIn account not required). 
I pay attention to his writing both in book and short form on LinkedIn or his blog.

## ## Tools spotlight 

It is so good that I have to share it. *Gavin Asthon* (do follow him if you are interested in security) introduced me today to a new tool - *[Typora](https://typora.io)*. 

﻿﻿**Boy, how I love it!** 

Typora is a markdown editor. I typed those newsletters in VS Code before that, but there is no way back. Typora all the way for now. Give it a try if  you work with text and markdown.

## ﻿﻿**## Digital me**

This week a lot had happened in my digital realm. You were the first one to  see my podcast. For me, it is a good start - #2 on the Apple podcast in  Technology in Poland. 



​                      [             ![Chartable - Apple podcast standing in technology](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/cdbb5c9117c2871a5eb6e2bc3fadd29609df9c28.png)           ](https://link.chtbl.com/xYp2bbHl)                    

**YaY** 

Never expected that. The next episode is coming this Tuesday on strategy in technology and personal development. Stay tuned. 

I also published a blog post about my approach to social media at the  moment. It is critical but well. Here is where I landed. Read it if you  like - *[Digital Minimalism - removing myself (yourself) from social media game](https://link.chtbl.com/xYp2bbHl)*.

That's all, folks. I need to work on a "short" in a short form. I'm back this  Tuesday in your Inbox with a regular e-mail and a new podcast episode. 

Stay safe. 

Get good rest. 

Enjoy the weekend.
