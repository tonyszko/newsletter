# Friday's spotlight #8

## Engineering manger's checklist, Signal, books and an ASK for your input



---



**Hi** 

A week has passed and here's a next one with things found last week. Before I will get to it ... 

Thank you for the feedback - I got few e-mails from some of you sharing  answers to my questions and touching on the topics essential for you. I  am much appreciated.  It is what we are undervaluing in communication  with e-mail, a 1:1 touch with people. 

I will quote here Alex (I still owe you a reply, it is coming) from one of those e-mails: 

*(...) It is what I* *personally* *miss in your e-mails - to read what other people say when you pitched the topic. But as I was writing these very words, I* *truly* *understood what you meant by "private touch".* Right now, I'm writing to you and only you, avoiding "public speaking". And it has something good in it. (...)

I very much agree! And when it comes to "pass on" what others are "pitching," - I do it all the time between the lines. 

Here come's a more straightforward one - there's one common theme in questions and comments I get from you. 

**Burnout.** 

That's sad. It is something which hunts a lot of people, especially in the IT  industry but not only. I had to handle it on my own in the past, more  than once, to be honest. I'm writing a longer piece on it for next week  to share my thoughts and experience with it and how I deal/dealt with  it. Here's one for you:

- What questions you have around the "burnout" for yourself or based on your experience? 

- If you have dealt with it in the past, how did you handled it, what helped you? 

I will put in it my thinking, but there are almost 250 of us here, and  I'm sure there are people who handled it better than myself. Here is a  place I can gather it and broadcast it to all you back. 

If you want to share your question or personal story - write me! 

Now let's get back to our Friday's routine. Friday's spotlight #9 ... here  it comes (BTW - who spotted how badly I messed up numbering in the last  two e-mails :)? )

### Bookmark's spotlight

**Becoming an engineering manager**

You, same as me, have some career trajectory. One day it might take you to  the new, unknown territory - the job of Engineering Manager. Here's a  great resource and checklist: A Checklist For First-Time Engineering  Managers ([LINK](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/checklist-for-first-time-managers/) - you can also click an image)!

​                      [             ![A Checklist For First-Time Engineering Managers](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/2b13c7c86af8cde3b65904d7b804bccff90842b5.png)           ](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/checklist-for-first-time-managers/)                    



I first started to think about it after reading a "Manager's path" ([LINK](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth-ebook/dp/B06XP3GJ7F)), a book I still recommend very often. You may think about such a step as a promotion because you do your job well, and you should excel in your  new career at the same level. The truth is, most likely; you suck on it! Yup! Time to stomach the fact - in many cases, after such a move, you  don't know what to do and what is expected of you. 

This checklist provides some orientation around what is expected from people taking on the role of engineering manager. "Manager" has a negative  connotation in technical circles. Still, in engineering organizations,  it is a great path forward for people who can stay with technology and  develop a different skillset.



**Self Help Newsletter (it is not what you would thing)**

Here's a one ... I'm not sure what to tell you about it, but here it is - Stephen Elliott's Self Help Newsletter ([LINK](https://stephenstack.substack.com/subscribe)). I found it through recommendation, and I got hooked on this guy's  writing. The thing is, it is not on any specific subject. Stephen picks  some topics and tries to explore them from a pragmatic point of view.  The "What's it about" section tells it all:

(...) Self help, unexpected advice, how to do things you haven't thought  about doing and maybe don't want to do. Interviews with interesting  people, single digit millionaires. Financial planning for poets. (...)

​                      [             ![Stephen Elliott's Self Help Newsletter](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/e12a0ef364da81406388232cba9ade526963d514.png)           ](https://stephenstack.substack.com/subscribe)                    



You don't know what to expect next, but the writing is top-notch. I find it entertaining to read but also helpful to give me some hints on random  topics I would not even pick up on my own. 

We all like when technology makes life easier, but sometimes it has a  price we are not aware of too if we will not dig a bit deeper. Here's  one you should be aware of and make your own decision around it.



**Asymmetry on food ordering front**

Do you order food using Uber Eats, Doordash, or GrubHub? I did in the past; now, I don't do it anymore. Why? 

This thread on Twitter shows a background of it from the restaurant's  owner's point of view - "I started learning to code properly because I  was pissed off. y'all know I used to run a restaurant, right?"

​                      [             ![I started to learn to code properly because I was pissed off](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/82764f871673713d1adedd12f2eea098b76b7bf7.png)           ](https://twitter.com/poppacalypse/status/1384165656610758656)                    

There's more to this story than only the part this guy highlighted. Technology  made it easy for us to order food from a single place. Still, the great  disproportion of power it gave to the platforms, backed with VC money,  can lose money and do not play on the expense of restaurants. I made my  decision long before the pandemic, and I removed food delivery apps from my phone. I'm not telling you you should do the same, but it is good to know how it works and be aware of both technology sides. 

On the bright side, it is also a good case of how technology enables people to take things into their own hands to change them.



**Signal drama: double edge sword**

We all love a good drama, and here's a good one from the Security area.  Are you using Signal? I do, and I recommend it to all my friends and  family. This one is not about the switch to a different messaging app. 

The Signal is an app that provides encryption and privacy of communication. Some time ago, one of the companies delivering a "surveillance" tools  used by the government claimed their ability to access Signal's  information from devices. Well ... have you heard about the double edge  sword? Here's a one. 

Signal got their hands on this company's product (as they wrote - (...) By a  truly unbelievable coincidence, I was recently out for a walk when I saw a small package fall off a truck ahead of me (...)) and did a security  analysis of it. Click on the picture for a full article ([LINK](https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-vulnerabilities/)).

​                      [             ![Exploiting vulnerabilities in Cellebrite UFED and Physical Analyzer from an app's perspective](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/9217867f950e34db49244aded08b5f77097e04d1.png)           ](https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-vulnerabilities/)                    

The result:

- It is outdated, and it is using libraries since 2012 (yes!)

- It most likely violates Apple's copyright. 

- It can be used to hack and execute a take over of a machine of person who is using it (presumably - a secret service)

The brilliant case that you should make sure that your backyard is clear  before pointing out someone else's backyard. BTW - read the last part of this article :). 





You should be accustomed by now that the books I recommend are not always  on technology topics. I read broadly, and I recommend it to you as well. Here are two which I picked recently and I liked.

***[The Ministry for the Future](https://www.amazon.com/Ministry-Future-Kim-Stanley-Robinson-ebook/dp/B084FY1NXB):** A Novel* ([LINK](https://www.amazon.com/Ministry-Future-Kim-Stanley-Robinson-ebook/dp/B084FY1NXB)) is a SciFi book about our near future (or now) and how it might look  from a climate crisis perspective. No, it isn't a way you think; it is  not a doomsday scenario story. It explores how the different actions and solutions might unfold, vowing it around the life of few people and  their stories. Excellent exploration of ideas around technology,  political and social system changes, and I found it interesting and  inspiring. 

**[E\*mpire of Pain\*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08ND91K6G/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title)\*:\*** *The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty* ([LINK](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08ND91K6G/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title)) is on a different bookshelf. It explores the history and modern time of a pharma industry family and how their approach and actions lead to the opioids crisis in the United States. The story of all that can go wrong when you put financial success first and moral dilemma second. Yet, it  is not only about it and areas I found pretty interesting in the first  30% of a book:

- The story of the family and how it emerged from the grounds up

- How the modern pharma advertising industry was created and emerged

It is a long read, but I found it quite interesting. If you want to read more on the problem side (opioid crisis), you can read [Dopesick](https://www.amazon.com/Dopesick-Dealers-Doctors-Company-Addicted-ebook/dp/B078D67JCF).



And that's it for today. Enjoy your weekend and the week to come. 

I look forward to getting your thoughts/questions/storied on burnout. I see it as a deep topic, and I will scratch it. 

See you in your inbox next week.
