## Privacy, VR, books and *something special*

﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿**Hi, my friends** 

How was your week? Great? Anything interesting had happened? 

It is Friday afternoon again. Time for Friday's Spotlight #2 to give you some thoughts and links for the weekend. **

​                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)

The Clubhouse is a new social media kid on the block. Not everybody can get it; you need an iPhone and invite (if you want one, ping me - I still  have some invites spare).
Every social media comes with some price -  in this case, we still don't know what it is. What has changed is that  people look at it from the start. 

Here is a good piece from Inc - [Clubhouse Is Recording Your Conversations. That's Not Even Its Worst Privacy Problem](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/clubhouse-is-recording-your-conversations-thats-not-even-its-worst-privacy-problem.html) looking at privacy side of Clubhouse.

What if someone can train the Machine Learning model to speak like you? Clubhouse gives them a perfect sample. 

You don't think it is possible? 

Last week a deep-fake account on Tik Tok impersonated Tom Cruise. This  account has all videos removed, but you can still watch it here. 

Pretty impressive!  

If we are on privacy - it will be an important topic for years to come.   Apple started first to differentiate itself on it (privacy) in its  business model. As Apple presses it, it undermines two other giants'  business models - you can guess that Google and Facebook are not happy. 

At least one of those two decided to follow suit. In an unforeseen turn of events, Google wants to kill third-party cookie tracing - [Google promises it won't keep tracking you after replacing cookies](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310332/google-privacy-replacing-third-party-cookies-privacy-sandbox?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4).

Do you know what Google? I have to say it. 

**I don't trust you.** 

**Sorry.** 

They did the math (or data analysis), and they know they control so many  signals on users that they can still sell ads without those cookies. So  long Facebook and other people are relying on cookies. 

I will write a broader piece on it for a blog. 

Time will tell how it will play out, but privacy is a thing we will hear more and more in coming years.

## **## Technology spotlight**


As you can see, spotlight sections change from week to week. I don't want  to keep you bored. It is an Ignite week - a Microsoft showcase of its  newest and most marvelous things for geeks worldwide. 

And you know what - I joined it in VR. Here's my selfie with Satya on stage (it was dark, I know it).  



​                      ![Satya Nadela on stage during MS Ignite in VR](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/fe3e2bca70e054eba7355efd0b8d3888f21b54a3.png/4620ee14a04602e4decaa8c41375049d4f44eda1.png)                    

Did I write a year ago that conferences will go to VR? 

﻿**Of course, I DID!** 

Exactly a year before this event - [﻿﻿﻿Events and conferences goes VR!](https://www.onyszko.com/events-and-conferences-goes-vr/)

Now I can announce myself as a source of predictions, but I won't.  VR is  one of those things which will take off in the next years. We need more  companies to step-in into hardware, not only Facebook with its Oculus. 

I wrote about it in the newsletter two weeks ago, but here is one technology I will be watching - [Distributed Identity and Verifiable Credentials](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access-management/decentralized-identity-blockchain). It is now available for everyone to try (I will) as announced on Ignite. 

In years to come, we will see more distributed applications and use cases. Connected with privacy, solutions as DID gives us plumbing to build  upon it. 
Will it fly? I don't know - there is no crystal ball. 

It is one of the small bets I do in a technology area to stay informed and follow its development. When it comes to small bets, those help me be  antifragile, and it brings us to books! **

## ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿**## Books spotlight**

﻿Nothing new caught my eye this week. I'm going through two books I recommended  in a previous e-mail; GoodReads reviews will follow during the weekend. I want to recommend to you few books, which popup very often in recent  months. 
Please meet [Nassim's Taleb Incerto](https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-4-Book-Bundle-Randomness-Antifragile-ebook/dp/B00K5190LE). You can read each book in this series separately. If I can recommend it, read at least: 

- [﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Fooled by Randomness](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA0W5W/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i2)
- [Antifragil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083DJWGO/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0)e

All of them are worth the time to read. Especially [Antifragile, which I ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile)[re-read this winter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile), changes my thinking line in many aspects. **
