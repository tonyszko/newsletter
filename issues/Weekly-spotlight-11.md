# Friday's spotlight #11 

## The need for credibility, Vitalik Buterin, Edge computing - is it a future ... and more



---



 Hi 

Spring is blooming in the northern hemisphere, and it makes all sorts of  difference. If you are lucky to live in a place with the sun shining all over the year, it will be hard for you to understand that. This part of the year day is getting longer, and the sun shines early in the morning is something I appreciate .. when it is back :).



Here's another of my Friday's spotlight, and I finally came to the formula  which suites me. Now the question if it suits you. For the time being,  e-mails you get as a part of this newsletter will be structured in two  parts:

A bit longer topic, an essay on a topic I thought about or someone asked  me in last week. Those will be related to work, life, the general  direction of the universe, technology, and whatever my brain waves  produced the previous week. Expect unexpected, but I will keep the  general rule around topics useful in career and life with a mix of  technology strategy and trends.

In the second part, you will get findings and spotlights in different  areas I found interesting and worth reading and store from last week. If you don't have time to read my thoughts now and looking for some quick  nuggets - scroll a bit down, and you will find it. Then you can get back to this e-mail later over a coffee and read the longer part.

Let's see how it will work out. This small community is üí™ growing üí™, and it keeps me motivated to deliver 

Now let's go to our Friday's spotlight on The need for credibility and then to the weekend's worth list of resources and findings. 



### The need for credibility 

Yesterday I had a coaching session (or individual training on different subjects) with one of the guys from Predica (my company). I was asked about the  tools of the consultants needed for its work. It is a separate subject,  and I will cover it here or on the blog in another installment. Some  other events in the world from last week made me think afterward about  an ingredient of being a consultant or a professional, which is more  important than technical skills.

**CREDIBILITY.**

Hard to gain, build over the years. Easy to lose.

Credibility is not a hard currency, and you can not buy it, trade it, or transfer  it. In some ways, you can project it from one person to another (more on that at the moment). If you want to build a long haul career (there is  only such, there are not short term careers, it is a stunt then), you  need to have it, and to have it, you need to:

- **Realize you need it.** 
- **Work on building it.** 

Then what you need is to maintain it and spot for the events which might  destroy it. Let's talk about how you build it and then how to keep it  over time. (I skipped the part on realize that you need it, you need to  do this in your head or take my word for granted).



**How you build your credibility?** 

It is not a single event or training. Those are daily choices. Part of it  is your professional merit side - you need to know what you are doing.  That's granted. Then it is about how you choose to behave in the  situations you will encounter and what choices you made. 

In simple:

- **Be honest and open, even if it might not be aligned with your short-term interest in the short term.**
- **Think in positive-sum game terms and apply them to solve situations or propose solutions** 
- **Never pretend that you know something if you are not. Be open and suggest a way to move forward.** 

Let's talk about examples here. I was engaged with customers for some time,  and I managed to establish some trust that we (as a company) and I as a  person have something to say in our area. The customer approached me  with a question do we want to build a mobile application for them.

Yay! New business is coming, good. It is what I'm here for (at least ). Did I hope on it? Yes, but not how you think it happened:

1. I told them that what they try to do is the best way to move forward, use their funds and resources, and ask why they  want to do it. 
2. After I learned why they want to do it, I laid  down all the potential alternatives (using the standard app, using a  pre-made app kit, etc.). None of it involved us (as a company) doing any workaround with pros and cons. 
3. When customer explained their business reasons  to build it anyway (they had some), I told them in the open that I'm  happy to do it. Still, we are not the cheapest company in this area, and they can find someone who will do it for lesser money, and I'm happy to put them in touch with them. 

In the end, we've built it with them, and they are using it in production. Why? Because through this process and my approach (yeah, Tomek, do more of self tap over your shoulder üëè), I've built some credibility with  them, that I'm not looking for a short-term benefit here. I'm interested in the best interest and what problem they have to solve.

Will they face another problem, they will at least consider asking me for a  piece of advice. Why? Because I've established some credibility with  them. 

You may say it is an intelligent selling technique. It is applied only for a short-term benefit and is not displayed. If it is a short-term action,  it will become visible, and you will lose what you've built. 

**You built credibility by applying your professional knowledge with an  honest and open approach over a long-term period with a positive-sum  game approach.** 

No shortcuts - always think about the best course of action to solve the  problem. If you see b$hit around you. Call it (unless you can't do it,  in any other way than by calling it b$hit).

Do not pretend you know something if you don't. Say I DON'T KNOW if a  situation calls for it. That is important. Not knowing and admitting it, but taking ownership for getting to know or finding someone to know  builds your credibility. 

It is like a hard currency you gather over time and get a compounding  interest out of it. It builds over time, and over the years, you start  to benefit more and more from it.

Now, how to maintain it and not too lose it once you have it? 

- **Do not sacrifice your credibility for the short-term benefit or someone else short-term interest.** 
- **Do not be an imposter (it is OK to feel as such but being one is a different thing)**
- **Stand by your words and actions but be open enough to change it if the environment or facts change.** 

The two last points are more straightforward, but the first one needs some  explanation. Again - example from the previous conversation on the  mentoring session and seen many times in professional life.

You work with the customer, and you are not alone. There is another person  involved, your manager or person leading the project. It might actually  be your peer, which makes it even harder. You are discussing some  project issues with the customer. You see that it is wrong - the  proposed solution is not in the best long-term interest of a customer.  It is getting only worst from now. 

You are being called out by another person to use your credibility, to make customers complicit with this solution for the short-term benefit of  this person (solving an issue, moving forward with a project, closing a  deal). What to do? 

The same principle applies. If you think it is not the best course of action:

- Call it out in a reasonable way with merit  arguments. Give the person who put you in the spotlight a chance to  change the mind and back down if the situation requires it.
- If it doesn't work (sometimes you need more than one attempt), do not be afraid to call it for what it is. It is your  credibility at stake here. 

It might be tricky. Why? Because in a professional context, doing  something like this might put your short-term benefit at-risk - you  might lose a project, you might risk a conflict with the other person at the spot. Those things can be solved. But what is at risk as well as  eroding your credibility in the long term with such short-term actions.

**Your credibility is your currency. Build it and maintain it.** 

Here's an example of building credibility from this week in the crypto world. 



‚Äã                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)                                                                                            

### Person spotlight 

We had some very well-known people doing different actions in the crypto  world. One of them is an excellent example of building credibility in  action. Please meet Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum. 

As a founder of Ethereum, Vitalik is a well-known figure in the crypto  world. Some people tried to take advantage of it by sending him large  quantities of coins of their projects (not named here as I don't believe in their legitimacy and don't want to promote it) and use Vitalik's  credibility to boost their projects. We are speaking about millions of  USD here. 

Vitalik could pocket it and even use it to advance his cause. Such a move would destroy his credibility in the long term. What he did instead is a  brilliant case of sticking to your principles and building credibility. [He moved and sold or exchanged these tokens and transferred all of the proceeds to support India's COVID case and other projects](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-donates-1-billion-dog-themed-memecoin-india-covid-relief).

‚Äã                      [ ![Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Donates $1 Billion In Dog-Themed Memecoin To India Covid Relief Fund](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/e08ba346c253ee7b383a37b4c1f9ac03a28a5671.png) ](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-donates-1-billion-dog-themed-memecoin-india-covid-relief)                    





Vitalik is a person worth following and reading. He is an example of clear and  consistent thinking around many subjects, in many cases related to  change in society and technology connected with it, not only around  crypto. 

Here are places you can meet Vitalik:

- Blog: https://vitalik.ca/
- Twitter: [https://twitter.com/vitalikbut...](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin) 

In recent days I read his blog post "[The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html)." I recommend his writing.

Now it is time for a short review of what had happened in my browser over last week. 



‚Äã                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)

**Are we killing the free web?** 

It is hard to avoid crypto technology these days, but here it is an  indifferent aspect. It is also something that troubles me when observing the direction of technology. I'm asking myself now: Are we killing free web and chances for all of us? 

The rise of cryptocurrencies caused people to look for ways to generate  income through mining. Mining needs compute. One way to do it is to use  free resources provided by CI/CD tools to execute mining tasks. It is  becoming a significant problem as tools providers need to cover the cost of it. 

The problem is highlighted in this article: [Cryptocurrency is an abject disaster](https://drewdevault.com/2021/04/26/Cryptocurrency-is-a-disaster.html). 

‚Äã                      [ ![Cryptocurrency is an abject disaster](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/174e736110b085f9e06c9ce6241a40bc054ca36d.png) ](https://drewdevault.com/2021/04/26/Cryptocurrency-is-a-disaster.html)                    



Here is also a [Twitter thread on the subject of building and promoting dubious crypto projects](https://twitter.com/smdiehl/status/1391309574762795009). 

The result? Higher entry bar for legit users of those services and fewer  people entering the market over time. The scarcity of computer equipment which is also consumed for crypto mining, adds to it. 

I wonder if we are not killing the web with it one step at a time. What's your take on it? 



**Edge computing?** 

Are you learning Kubernetes? Should you start learning about Edge computing instead of it? Edge computing is a way to run your code ... on edge,  closer possible point to the actual user. It might be a CDN node, or it  might be your cell tower. 

Here is an interesting [piece from Stratechery about Cloudflare's efforts in this area](https://stratechery.com/2021/cloudflare-on-the-edge/) and how their approach and strategy might turn into a new path into  building applications, where data are kept and moved closer to the user. 

‚Äã                      [ ![Cloudflare on the Edge](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/f5ab9d6a0d90ea4478b9229aa4cceb9fe544459c.png) ](https://stratechery.com/2021/cloudflare-on-the-edge/)                    

What I like about a community around Wardley Maps because those topics are discussed there from many angles. [Here is an excellent thread where it is discussed.](https://twitter.com/basche42/status/1392406111995707393)

From this thread, I learned about AWS CloudFront Functions, the AWS way of running a code on Edge: [Introducing CloudFront Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-cloudfront-functions-run-your-code-at-the-edge-with-low-latency-at-any-scale/) ‚Äì Run Your Code at the Edge with Low Latency at Any Scale.

Is Edge computing the next big thing? Possibly. Look into it as it might  be something coming, and there is a way to build your advantage in it. 



**One more reason to buy a Security key - get rid of the captcha.** 

If we speak about Cloudflare, here is one more reason to buy Security Key from this company. Cloudflare works on a way of [solving captcha with the FIDO2](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cryptographic-attestation-of-personhood/) security keys. 

**YES!!!!** 

Anyway - if you don't have a security key, get one. Even if not for a captcha, use it to secure your e-mail and social accounts.



**Is Apple robing an FB bank for its own benefit?** 

If you are an iOS user, you might notice that recently iOS introduced a  new setting that allows you to opt-in (you are opted-out by default)  into the application tracking your behavior. Based on recent statistics, only 4% of users opted-in. 

‚Äã                      [ ![Only 4% of iOS users in US are opting in to ad tracking, report says](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/48f1ba0cc1f54642b966ae9eac06a082aea0477d.png) ](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/05/07/only-4-of-ios-users-in-us-are-opting-in-to-ad-tracking-report-says)                    

You know who is not happy with it? Yes, companies like Facebook live on  tracking users and for whom it is fuel for their business. 

Is Apple doing it for the user's benefit? Apple is building its  competitive advantage on building control over the entire user vertical. Remember, they are doing it for Apple and its shareholders (I'm not one of them) benefit. 

Here's a more sober article that points out the other side of this move, Apple taking over a cake from Facebook and others to eat it on its own:[ Apple robbed the mob's bank](https://mobiledevmemo.com/apple-robbed-the-mobs-bank/).

**AI is not here, but ML still does a great job!** 

AI is not there, at least not "I" in it, but it doesn't mean that Machine  Learning and Deep Learning algorithms can't do something useful. [Here's a stunning example of how deep learning algorithms can be used to make video games realistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1IcaBn3ej0). Watch it! 

‚Äã                      [ ![Enhancing Photorealism Enhancement](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/867003751c181c708a2b2704fe532686ea2d60db.png/722e8f186049f4fb2d4c601b2119a567958b7e38.png) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1IcaBn3ej0)                    

When we will have trouble finding a difference between CGI and reality is coming sooner than we think.

### Books spotlight 

If AI was mentioned - I've read this book:[ A Thousand Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Thousand-Brains-New-Theory-Intelligence/dp/1541675819). It is recommended if you want to get a glimpse of where we are at,  understand how our brain works, how it learns, and how it maps to  potential scenarios for AI development. I enjoyed it a lot. 

This book brings a vital discussion - is current technology a way AI will  work? The answer is in the book but a minor spoiler - not precisely.  Grab it. 

This e-mail is a loaded one, so I will let you rest a bit and save some  other tools, links, and books for next week. It still amazes me and  makes me smile when I see that more than 50% of you read this e-mail  regularly. 



**Big thank you!**



If I can do anything to make it better for you or have some questions, reply and send me an e-mail. I read them all. 



Stay safe and till the next time.
