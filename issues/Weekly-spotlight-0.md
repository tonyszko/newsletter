Hi



Relax, I'm not planning to flood you with e-mails. In my first e-mail, I asked if you would be interested in a shorter form, with highlights and findings from the week.

The majority of you said - hell yeah, so I decided to go with it, and now you see Friday Spotlight being born.

On Friday afternoon, I will write to you with highlights on things with caught my interest, persons I follow and find interesting, links, and more.

Friday Spotlight #1 covers:

- Topic Facebook actions and news standoff in Australia
- Person; DHH, why I follow him and I found their work at Basecamp interesting
- Bookmarks, things I read this week which I found interesting
- Books I read or added to my queue this week

I hope you will enjoy it.



## **## Topic: spotlight: Facebook and Australia are exchanging the kicks! Bad news, Facebook has won!**

I'm out of most of the social media. Why I still look at Facebook? We are in a period where a lot will be decided on the future shape of media, relations between govs and social media, and more general, BigTech.

Last week Australia attempted to tax Facebook (and others) for news they share (1:0 for Australia).

Result? Facebook kicked back and stopped serving news to people in Australia. More, it forbade people to post any links to news sites or blogs from Australia. (WoW, that hurts, 1:1 ).

As a result, Australia adopts more relaxed rules, which favor Facebook in this standoff (1:2 for Facebook).

Here's is the best description of this situation: [Facebook got everything it wanted out of Australia by being willing to do what the other guy wouldn't](https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/02/facebook-got-everything-it-wanted-out-of-australia-by-being-willing-to-do-what-the-other-guy-wouldnt/).

Why do it matters? It shapes the relationship between BigTech and governments across the World for years to come.



## **## Person spotlight: DHH, David Heinemeier Hansson**

If you don't know DHH, it is good to get to know him and the company he co-creates, Basecamp.

Why?

DHH and his partner Jason Fried show how you can build a business and run it . He (both) are also big proponents of getting the Internet right again. Less tracking, more simple stuff, calmly doing things.

Why it is important? Let's say it - they don't have to! They are well off with Basecamp; they can live from whatever wealth they gathered so far. Many people do it.

Yet, this gives them a position where they can be heard and make a difference. And they do it.

DHH, Jason, and Basecamp also show that you can build a product people will like and pay for if you will focus on user needs, not what is fancy at the moment.

If you are in software development, read [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup), Basecamp's guide on how to work and deliver. It goes against what is considered a norm now. Yet, they still provide.

I learn a lot from both of them, and it shapes my point of view in some cases. Try it.



## **## Bookmarks** 

Here are two things from many which caught my eye.

[Livepeer](https://livepeer.com/) - yet another Ethereum project. When everyone buys NFTs (collectibles on Blockchain), this project caught my eye. You can join the network and rent your GPU for others to process a video. Why this one? I see in such projects to build an alternative to BigTech (YT in this case). Those are not end games, but those are enablers. This one might fail; some one day will fly :).

Silicon Valley is not the only thing that glitters - [An RV Camp Sprang Up Outside Google's Headquarters. Now Mountain View Wants to Ban It ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-05-21/silicon-valley-s-shame-living-in-a-van-in-google-s-backyard) - this article tells about the situation BigTech creates in housing in its neighborhood. If you are from Europe, it is a strange problem (or not this scale). If you get interested in this topic, you may read more in [Nomadland](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KGPLS4Z/).



## **## Books spotlight**

Here are two titles I've added to my queue this week:

- [Working Backwards: Insights, Stories, and Secrets from Inside Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Backwards-Insights-Stories-Secrets-ebook/dp/B08BYCQBZN)
- [Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08191DV5T/)

Not read yet, but I plan to read them both. The review will appear on GoodReads.

That's it.

I need to work on a shorter form. That is next week.

For now, have a great weekend.
