# Weekly spotlight #26 

## Mapping a run üèÉ to a career and life - focus on lead indicators, how AWS compete with others, energy and sand shortage and more 



---



Hi

Mid-week edition of the weekly spotlight. It was a race weekend. I took my usual Saturday off the computer (try it), and Sunday, it was about running a half-marathon. 

I should prepare it, then update and hit "send," but OK - that was a thought, and after the run, my internal battery depleted. It wasn't physically challenging (OK, it was in the first 30 minutes after the run). Still, mentally I was done for a day. 

Now with some rest, I can get back to writing. 

About the race (if you are curious): I did well. First thought after the race was, "Oh, I missed it," but then it was - 1:34:51 for a half-marathon is a great time. I even qualified in the top 100 men in my age category.

Conclusion. Always pick your battle and age category :).

More serious conclusion after this run:

1. Focus on what you can control and on lead indicators 
2. Be careful with mental accounting. 

### Focus on what you can control and on lead indicators

Great book "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" (seriously, I recommend it to everyone to read at least once) points *"Begin with the end in mind"* as one of those habits. It is true. Not having an end in mind can be a disaster; you will drift in many directions in the best case. At worst ... you will finish where you don't want to be. 

At the same time, I'm not so found about strict goal settings - one of many contradictions in my thinking (you have to get used to it).

In this particular case, an end was clear - finish the run. That's it. There was also a plan and some assumptions about the result, but none was set in stone. 

Even in a simple event, as a run, there are many moving parts and elements you can focus on: other people, starting position, weather, route, competition. I picked it up on purpose, as all of them are things outside of your control. 

Even the final result itself is a thing outside of your control. You can do everything right, and then your shoe might break, or muscle cramps can hit you. 

Here are lead indicators. If you haven't done MBA (as I), you might not be familiar with it, but there are two types of indicators (simplifying):

- **Lead**: happens before the result and are input into the process execution
- **Lag**: occurs as a result of a process and can be measured after the process will execute.

In the context of race, the result is a ***lag\*** indicator. It is a result at the end of everything that will happen between the start and finishes (and also what happens before the start, namely training). Whatever you think about it, **you can't control it**.

What you can control are lead indicators. Suppose you put all the right effort into elements influencing lead indicators and execute a process (run). In that case, the result will happen‚Äîat least some version of it. 

How I exercised this approach in my run in practice:

- I did my training - that is given, there is no result without preparation. It was the first time I had a scheduled training with some structure in the last six weeks before my run. 
- I removed the result from my watch for the race. During the race, I was able to control only my heart rate and pace on my eye. Every kilometer passed my average speed during the last single kilometer distance. 
- I had an indicator of pace range, which is needed to run on average within my target goal.

Doing it this way lets me focus on lead indicators in my run:

- Try to run each kilometer one at a time within the range ( I run the first ten not according to the plan, a bit faster)
- Stay fed and hydrated.

Last but not least: I reminded myself, "you run alone; it is not a race with others." Why? There is always a push to run with other runners as he can "pull you a bit." Why is it dangerous if it isn't your fellow runner with whom you set this plan together? 

Because you don't know their strategy and plan, they might run with a different approach and goal in mind, and for you, it might mean you will burn your energy on their pace.

Those lead indicators allowed me to focus on what I controlled, run each segment at a similar pace (on official marks, I always had 4:30m/km avg pace), and arrive at the finish line in planned time. 

Am I writing it all to brag about my run race? Nope. 

***I observe a lot of people who focus on lag indicators that are outside of their control!\***

Think about it. Things like sales goals, personal financial goals, development goals with distant time frames are beyond your control. Those are all "lag" indicators and while it is good to have it defined (*"Begin with the end in mind"*), what you should focus on is:

-  Find out the lead indicators that are input to this result: sales calls and meetings, your savings vs. spending rate, the number of certificates you did, or time you spend on building new skills. 
- Identify those within your control.
- Focus on execution of those goals which are within your control and measure lead indicators 

***Filter out the noise, focus on your definition of the end but don't think about it (the end) but things on the way, which contributes to it and you can control.\*** 

### The menace of mental accounting

What was the first thought when I arrived at the finish line of this race? You don't have to believe me, but it was "Oh crap, I missed it." What was "IT"? It was my expected result for the race.

I had a plan that assumed running it at 4:30m/km pace and finishes around 1h35m mark, but somewhere along the start line, I started to believe I could do it in 1h30m. 

That was mental accounting in action. I had this optimistic thought, "Maybe I can do it in 1h30m," and suddenly it was a goal in my head. Everything I could control was set to finish in my target time. I set My watch for it. It was a plan, but my mind started to believe in a "better version of a future."

It is a trap. 

It can diminish the fact that you did great and that you did what you planned, but somewhere along the lines, you "accounted" for a slightly better version of the truth. Then with your intended result, you are disappointed, even if before you would accept this result as a "flying A."

How to fight against it? Anchor your expectation. Write it down on a piece of paper or a note. Then look at it as a checkpoint when you think you did terribly. Is it terrible? 

I didn't write down the expected result this time. My anchor, in this case, was my coach calling me after the race and saying, *"What the f..k you are talking about?"* You did great, and it is a result you planned for it." He was right. 

If needed, a simple piece of paper with a noted goal can be your "What the f..k" call.

That was my overcomplicated stream of thoughts after the race and now, let's get to what you all were waiting for ... the weekly spotlight of articles, videos, books, and other findings from this week.

## Bookmarks spotlight 

### We are running out of sand.

Who would think about it, but not every sand is equal. We are running out of the resource, which nobody has thought about: [A sand shortage? The world is running out of a crucial ‚Äî but under-appreciated ‚Äî commodity](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/sand-shortage-the-world-is-running-out-of-a-crucial-commodity.html).

Far from sounding a global alarm on it as I don't know enough on the subject, but here is a thought about it. We know so little about the supply chain, which powers our world right now. I can imagine there is only a handful of people who understands this as a whole. Think about the things you are using daily and try to figure out a supply chain for it, like for concrete.

If you haven't met this gentleman before, please let me introduce you to [Vaclav Smil](https://vaclavsmil.com/). His book [Harvesting the Biosphere: What We Have Taken from Nature](https://vaclavsmil.com/2012/12/21/harvesting-the-biosphere-what-we-have-taken-from-nature/) deals with our consumption of materials from the Earth (all materials). His books are not precisely page-turners because they are packed with numbers and analysis but highly recommended. I pick one from time to time, and he is one of the favorite authors of Bill Gates (and it says something).

### How to outmaneuver competitors: AWS, Wardley Maps, OMG! 

What can be better than technology strategy and Wardley Maps together? Here's a short but packed thread on Twitter that explains with Wardley Maps how AWS has taken over the competition in the Fraud Detection area through the commoditization of the components - [Storytime: A while ago, #AWS outmaneuvered one of our competitors in the cloud](https://twitter.com/jduffy/status/1440320398738870275).

Nice use case of several things:

- How Wardley Maps can be used to analyze moves afterward, but more importantly, before events will unfold. 
- How Amazon "Amazoned" competition (and continue doing so) with its commodity components and why it is hard to compete with them. 
- How situational awareness matters. 
- AWS is one giant [sensing machine](https://www.onyszko.com/sensing-machine/) for Amazon. 

### Gig economy workers - a vast workforce around us

In the previous e-mail, I linked a story about the gig workers in delivery from New York. The gig economy is around us, and it will stay. It is a vast workforce, and here is a report on how they perceive their work, salary, and other elements across the world based on a survey of 5000 people in this sector: [The gig workers index: Mixed emotions, dim prospects](https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-index-mixed-emotions-dim-prospects/).

Most likely, you are not considering joining this workforce (are you?), but it is part of our reality now, and good to understand its dynamics. 

### It's tough being an Azure fan (opinion)

I spend most of my professional time focusing on Azure but keeping an eye on other vendors. I believe such focus on ecosystem or specific area helps get to the right level of expertise and proficiency. It doesn't mean I don't see flaws in Azure :).

Here is an opinion from the fellow CTO - [It's tough being an Azure fan](https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-index-mixed-emotions-dim-prospects/) who points out his view on why Azure might not be that perfect. Worth reading if you are in Azure and even if you are not. I would dispute a few things, but in a broader context, for example, the security part - that was a bad period for Azure, but I think overall they are doing good on it, but again - my biased opinion. 

What are your thoughts? Similar points on Azure? Other vendors? Share it; I will compile it and send it back as a broadcast.

### China and energy again - electronics shortage might get worst.

I'm trying to be optimistic, but looking across the world, we might have some problems with energy going forward. China enforced energy saving plans and planned outages, which affects Apple (and possibly others) supply chains (again, those pesky supply chains) - [Key Apple, Tesla suppliers halt production amid China's power crunch](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Key-Apple-Tesla-suppliers-halt-production-amid-China-power-crunch).

I ordered my new PC yesterday. I expect prices and availability will not get better in next year and maybe even 2023. Perhaps I'm wrong, but signals like this one confirm some troubles ahead.

### Mapping innovation for a product

Another one with Wardley Maps, but an interesting one. How to map an innovation for software B2C products and where it happens? Here is a piece about it - [Equation of invention for a software product (b2c)](https://joapen.com/blog/2021/09/26/equation-of-innovation-for-a-software-product-b2c/). This e-mail is a bit on the technology strategy side :). 

Read it, explore doctrines highlighted, and in the end, it is all about learning. Those who master knowledge as a process within the company will live long and prosper!. 

## Books

There are no new books picked up this week; I'm still going through the stack I picked up from [Stripe Press](https://press.stripe.com/). I have picked up one pre-order for [Practical Doomsday, A User's Guide to the End of the World](https://nostarch.com/practical-doomsday) - check it; maybe you will like it as well. I have this strange feeling that I wrote about it before, but there are many new folks here, so it is good to remind them about it. 

## Media

It is always the most challenging step to start, and that was for me and the podcast after a short break. Still, here it is again (it is Polish) - this time with fellow security strategy consultant Jakub Kaluzny. 

[Wojtek Lisicki summarized nicely](https://twitter.com/WLesicki) key points from it: 

1. Very rarely in our career, we make decisions that will end our career forever - do not be afraid to make decisions.
2. Shift-the left - This concept/approach is worth taking a look at.
3. As "security people," let's have empathy for the people we work with. Kuba mentioned here mainly about developers, but it applies to everyone.

Pick the whole story (in Polish) here if you want to listen to it. For my English friends, I picked a task to add an English transcription to it and automate its delivery. Keep your fingers crossed :). 

That's all this week. I'm really happy to see new faces (e-mails) and the number of you here constantly going a bit up. That means you enjoy what I write, and it is the best reward for the effort here. 

Keep making the world a bit better every day.
