# You, blockchain and your personal brand



---



Hi friends 



Greetings from Warsaw in (unexpected) springtime! 

It's been two weeks since we last met, and I want to thank you for the positive feedback I've got after the first e-mail. Nice to know that you are out there reading. Some of you are also responding and sending direct comments. 

We all need feedback, and we all need to learn to give it. It is a must, but I will leave it for another day, with one quick tip about it here. 

When in doubt about your skills or work quality, ask yourself this question:

*When was the last time you got positive feedback from someone on your work?* 

You can't recall when? Go and ask someone about it. You might be surprised how correlated those two things are. We are social animals, and we need support from our pack to let us know that we are doing the right thing. 

**>> THANK YOU for your feedback and reading this e-mail <<** 

Now let's unravel the subject and connect blockchain to your brand. 

One thing before I will begin. No! I will not speak about Bitcoin and investing in crypto. Go to TikTok or another place. You will find it in plenty. 

It is hard nowadays to move into the tech world and not think about crypto. It made me curious to get a bit of an update on the current state of technology in the crypto world. Digging around the crypto and reading some other materials brought me to this! 

##  >> With a decentralized network of services, you will need your brand!<<

Bear with me until the end, and I will connect all the dots. 





## **## Let's talk crypto for a moment** 

If I say "crypto," you would think "coins" and "cryptocurrencies." It is the most common connection you may have with this subject unless you are interested in it. 

Cryptocurrencies make people tick. Rising prices, making a quick buck (at least some), and predictions that they will replace standard currencies make a noise. 

You might miss that besides the monetary value of coins, some of them have utility value. What is utility value? It means that you can do something using the network on which this *crypto* operates.

What is this something? It will vary by the network and project:

- You can run programs to execute transactions, referred to as smart contracts 
- You can send transactions between different blockchains (each of these networks is independent)
- You can transfer value (money) from one place to another
- You can prove the authenticity of some document or your identity (it is coming)

In general - you can do some transactions. Transactions are being done in the network using blockchain to store its record. Technical details vary, but it is a general idea in a nutshell. Those networks replicate some of the functions you might have in the "current" systems. More efficiently, faster, and independent (not always).

You use banks to transfer funds between accounts. We have a crypto network moving value at internet speed and doing it faster than the wire transfer. 

You use your ID to prove you are a person; soon have a Digital ID, based on the blockchain, to project your identity on the web—no limits on accepting it. 

You've got the point. 

Here's a good read on how blockchain-based networks stack to current financial services systems: [Out With The Old, In With The New](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/y5j35ziqhik4g73j.).

Are you still with me? I hope so. Let's put another dot on the map. 

##  

## **## Your relations with the world will change** 

Why? 

It is simple. Those networks provide better utility service, faster, and get a scale, most likely cheaper. What is more important - they are not connected to your place of living or authority. 

*What? I can't even go and buy coffee with Bitcoin right now!*

You are right, but it is only about one of those projects best known for ordinary people. Other networks have been used even now when many are forming or proving themselves. Technology will mature. Adoption will mature. The complexity of using it will become less "magic" for ordinary users. It will become hidden by a higher UX layer. It will get more straightforward and more friction-less over time. 

People will build higher-level services on top of these networks. It will let you transfer money, verify documents, prove your work, or sign papers—fast, effortless, with no intermediate party. 

Here's an example that is happening. Microsoft is cooking "blockchain" identity for you to use: [Decentralized digital identities and blockchain: The future as we see it](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/decentralized-digital-identities-and-blockchain-the-future-as-we/ba-p/1994714). 

**It is happening.** 



Technology aside - what will it mean for you or me as a person? Things we do every day will get less attached to the physical location and work. Transfer of information will become faster. Doing official businesses will be done online more and more. 

People will build new services to deliver a new reality to people who will be willing to live and work on this new "layer." Some countries and places will be more inclined to accept it. Some will be resisting. 

Those places, which will embrace it faster, will attract more people like you—skilled, technology savvy. Some are doing it already. If you haven't seen it yet, [Estonia, a small country in Europe, offers e-residency for anyone](https://e-resident.gov.ee/).

**>> Work and life will become more decentralized <<** 

I recently read (OK, listened - if you haven't tried yet, try audiobooks) to this book - [*The Sovereign Individual: Mastering the Transition to the Information Age*](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3851433403) (you can follow me on GoodReads for future reviews). It isn't perfect, and I gave it only three stars, as it should be more in-depth and shows only one side of the coin. It was written 21 years ago, but what this book is about will happen in the next years. 

**>> Your life will become more decentralized. <<**

Because of those new services delivered on blockchain networks, the price of Bitcoin might go down. Still, the value of utility offered by these services will remain. 





## **## You need your brand; it will have more value in the decentralized world**

Here dots are connecting. At least at a very high level and in my thinking (but hey, signing up, you decided to receive my stream of thoughts).

What do you need to get a new job now? Skills, that's one. Between two persons with the same abilities - what will decide? 

Many factors influence it, but there is also a matter of trust in you as a person. 

How this trust works right now? You can project it through people you know (your network) and references. You can also show it by the proof of work - what you have done in the past. 

What helps you now is having something called a "personal brand." People recognize you in some areas for what you've done and what you know. Right now, it is nice to have. The more decentralized world of technology, your brand will help you even more. 

Having a brand is not becoming a celebrity. It doesn't mean you need to get thousands of followers, posting every day on Instagram (or what service will be fancy in the future).

Having a brand means:

- It is clear what is your area of expertise. 
- You have a voice in your area, and you use it. 
- There is proof of quality behind you. 

**>> Your brand is what I will see, even before I will contact you.<<** 

It has to tell me what you do, your idea of yourself, what you have done so far, your opinions. 

You say there is plenty of people doing what you do right now. You are right. That's why you need to stand out! 

You say you are not doing anything extraordinary. You're mistaken. You haven't spoken about what you do. Tell the world about it, and you will find out that there are always people who want to listen. 

A personal brand's value will grow in a technology world (not only). It has to be a brand with weight in it, not only the shell of visibility. 

**If it is that crucial - start to control it.** 

Ensure that you can project who you are, what you know, and what you do outside of your town's local environment. Your brand will help you to project your person in the decentralized world. 

If it will not happen and all those networks people develop will come to waste, you will still have your brand. WIN!

It creates leverage. In the internet's decentralized world, it creates a force that you can use to create leverage. Read this - [*The Age of Infinite Leverage*](https://www.value.app/feed/the-age-of-infinite-leverage).

**How to start?** 

I got some advice in one of my blog posts - Where would I start building my work profile now? (https://www.onyszko.com/how-and-where-to-build-your-career/)

An excellent place to start might be to write. It is a skill you want to have - The most important skill you can learn at no cost? https://www.onyszko.com/the-most-important-skill-you-can-learn/

As Sebastian Gebski pointed out in his blog - [it might immediately make you stand out from the crowd (not only among developers).](https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/generation-of-illiterate-developers/)

Yeah ... I know, those dots were far away from each other, and it took a giant leap to connect them. To go from crypto to personal brand. Now you have an idea of how my thinking process works :). It is not easy to handle it and keep focus, but I manage. 

To wrap it up, check this web site - [https://ideamarket.io/. ](https://ideamarket.io/) It connects brands, trust to those brands on a blockchain. You can list there your own brand in the future.

This e-mail was a plenty - book club and technology in one. So let's finish it here. You might have something to think about. 

I hope you enjoyed it! 

If you want to get in touch and talk about those things, e-mail me or find me on [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/tonyszko)or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomaszonyszko/). There is also a new social media on the block - Clubhouse. If you use it, sometimes I jump into the discussions there. Find me in the app and follow. 



See you in two weeks!
