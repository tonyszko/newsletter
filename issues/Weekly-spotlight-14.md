# Friday's spotlight #14

## Staying productive and sane, a need for slack, OODA Loop and some CyberPunk



---



Last week I wrote that I'm going to enjoy a bit of off-line time with family in the countryside. And I did! 

I spent a couple of days in a tranquil village with a river flowing  across the road from a home we rented. Here is how it looked without any photo editing. 

​                      ![Narew river](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/d217eafca1da293bcb5bcd3a3f2a65a6ff265be4.jpeg)                    

Why I'm sharing it? I plan to finish some articles and write this e-mail  there in the mornings before my family wake-up. In the end, I didn't -  why? 

We all need time to re-wind and slow down. I decided that I need this more than finishing some posts or writing new content. My laptop stayed for  almost four days in the backpack, not touched at all. 

It brings me to the question people asked me several times recently.

﻿***You are so productive! How you handle all of it and producing all those things besides running a company and having a family?\* \*How can you do it and not become burned out?\*** 

First of all, remember that you see only the outcome and do not compare  yourself and your productivity to me or anyone else. It is the best way  to get depressed and put yourself into a rabbit hole of chasing "I need  to do more" rabbit. 

Honest confession - I'm the opposite of being productive - at least it is how I see myself :). It is not my default state "TO DO" things. I had to  build some habits around it to be able to work with others around me. 

Yet I still deliver - the question is how? Here is how I approach it.



***I look for "doers" around me and pair with them to deliver\*** 



No, it doesn't mean piggyback on someone else work, but I try to work in  pairs with people who have a different set of strengths, where I can use my strengths. I learned that trying to overcome my weaknesses is less  productive than using some hacks to keep them at bay and using my strong side to deliver and contribute.

It requires two things. First - getting to know and accepting your weak  and robust side and admitting that you are not good at some things.  Second - being able to talk about it with others and build on it openly. 

For me, the worst parts of my professional life happened when I tried to do something I'm not good at doing, and I was not open about it. I  suffered, and people who worked with me suffered. I used some external  help and came to terms with what I can and can't do. 

Then I learned how to communicate with people, and then everything clicked.  Nowadays, if you would work with me, it is likely that you would hear  something like "I'm not the best person to do it" or "I'm not good at  it, so you should consider someone else." 

I focus on doing things where I know I can deliver value based on my strengths and leverage them. 



***If I can't keep up with tasks, it means I took too much of myself\****.*



It is another realization I got overtime. If your **to-do** list is never finished, it is not that you are not doing enough. It means that you put too much on your **to-do** list. Try to put less on your plate and see if you can eat it. 

How much is good for you? I don't know - you need to experiment. Try to put one task per day and do it. Then add two or three more, consider their  size, and do it. You will find your perfect spot. 

It is you who create pressure on you to do more. Not external people or  force - in the end, it is you. If you still have too much on your plate, then you need to do one or better both of those two things:

Say no to more things. . Someone asks you to speak at the event. Is it your target to be a public speaker this year? No? Say no! Yes? Is it an  event with the right impact? If the answer is "no," then say "No." 

The same applies to work and private life. You should be at "NO" almost by  default and then look into why you should say "YES" to a new task or  opportunity. Guard your time. Time and attention are your limited  resources or high value. 

Second thing - delegate and outsource. You can delegate and outsource to other people or the automation tools. Example: I have a podcast. The only  thing I do with it is finding people and talking with them. The entire  production process is delegated, and both myself and the person who does it for me are happy with it. I have a podcast done better than I can do it myself, and he has an income. 

﻿***Taking fewer tasks, saying "NO" more often, and delegating is your way to do more.\*** 



***I take time to unwind and relax, and you should as well\****.*



There is always something more to be done. There is another blog to write,  code to deliver, and the world will always put something on your plate.  To handle what you will take on your own, you need to be rested and give your mind and body time to recover. 

Here I don't do anything fancy - no complex rituals or sessions with coaches. Simple things:

I sleep at least seven or eight hours every day. It wasn't like that I'm a night owl in the past, and I was trying to catch up with things in the  night. Then I realized how it destroys my productivity and that I need  to stop. When I have something to catch up on, I go to sleep early, wake up early after an excellent and long sleep, and do it in the morning. 

﻿***Long sleep regularly does magic.\*** 

I run. It might be something different for you, but each of us needs some physical activity to let our mind rest and get support from the body. I run because it allows me to clear my mind, and it keeps me fit. It  doesn't have to be 10 kilometers from the start - start with something  small, but begin to do it.

​                      ![My last seven days of activities and sleep](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/5f95e04e048e5135052069c75a8607611ff9ac09.jpeg)                    

Those three simple things let me keep my output at some level. The key here  is that I took the pressure off myself that I need to do a lot. I don't, and you don't need to do a lot as well. 

**The goal is to keep it at a steady pace with good quality, maintaining your physical and mental health.** 

***Take the pressure off yourself. Typically you put it on yourself on your own, not external people or "the world."\*** 

And that's why I decided to keep my laptop in my backpack for those four  days. Now let's dive into what I found for you last week (shorter  because of my time off) - Friday's Spotlight #14 goodies for you. 

​                                                                                                                                          



### Bookmarks spotlight 

﻿﻿**Why you need slack in your life?**

No, I don't mean you need to spend more time on Slack - notice lower-caps  "s" in a "slack." BTW - I never hooked up on Slack and not using it  almost at all. Too much distraction. 

Here is a blog post from Farnam Street - [Efficiency is the Enemy](https://fs.blog/2021/05/slack/). It is a summary of a book titled "[Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767907698/)" (I haven't read it yet, added to the "to read" list). This post is  about the need to have space in your time - a slack-to respond if  something will arise or an opportunity be presented in front of you. 

I have some slack in my time all the time right now. Yes, I know, it  sounds strange, but it is a fact. I don't have my calendar booked, and  every day I have focus time scheduled, but not always expected things in it to be done. It let me pick tasks that emerge and pick some thoughts I had in the past, and follow up. Or schedule a meeting with someone who  asks about it. Or ... be bored. 

Being bored is well underrated. In the state of being bored, you come up with great ideas, and if you have some slack in your schedule, you have time to tinker with those. 

If you want to read something along those lines and haven't read "[The Goal](https://www.amazon.com/The-Goal-audiobook/dp/B00IFGGDA2/)" yet, I recommend it. It discusses the theory of constraints in a very  approachable way. You will understand better why "slack" is needed in a  system, be it your time or company.



﻿﻿**OODA Loop - dealing with complexity** 

This one might be something you will skip or something that will be your  next "aha" moment in your toolbox. You could spot few times that I have  my interest in the strategy and complexity of what is around us. It took me to the rabbit hole, which contains the term OODA Loop. 

OODA stands for **O**bserve - **O**rient - **D**ecide - **A**ct and the process of using those actions in a loop to orient yourself and act in a fast-changing environment. 

OODA Loop and how it might help you handle complexity - this podcast with Ben Ford, "[OODA for operational excellence](https://changelog.com/shipit/4)," might give you some overview of what it is and how it might help you. 

I've met Ben at one of the conferences around strategy, and we hit it off.  He has a great story of learning programming on the ship to Afghanistan  as a Royal Marine (crazy story). Still, now he is applying the military  experience and ways to operate to our IT environment. 

OODA Loop is not a simple concept, but it is worth spending a few moments to try to understand it and how it applies to your environment, be it  development or operations. 

​                      [ ![OODA Loop by Ben Ford](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/0e8100d2124d6ebdc97179670ce7cf66ceee831a.png/6b9bfd7ad18eeab5f3e9573343d41739629762a0.png) ](https://commando.dev/)                    

(Last but not least, I'm blown away with graphics Ben has created to illustrate OODA Loop concepts)



﻿﻿**Adding vs. subtracting: it seems we have a clear preference**.

Here's an interesting one - based on the result of some experiments, we prefer to solve a problem by adding elements to solve it, even if subtracting  from what is already out there also solves a problem, sometimes in a  better way. Here's nature's article about those results - [Adding is favored over subtracting in problem-solving](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00592-0).

Think about it. 

What is the solution to the problem with a system many times? Adding a layer of abstraction or adding a tool overcomes an issue - a pre-processing,  translation, interface exchanging data, you name it. 

hat is the most common solution to solve some work not being handled in the company? Define a new position and hire someone to take it, but should  we look into the work itself or generate it to remove it from the  picture? 

I never thought about it before in this way, but looking back in the  past, that had happened many times. The first idea is always to add  something that solves a problem. To think about "removing" requires a  deliberate effort even to start to think about it. 

I resolve to challenge myself to go into this "substracting" path of  thinking when presented with a technical or organizational problem. 



﻿﻿**Dynamo Dream - a YouTube, cyberpunk series**

I'm a big fan of Sci-Fi and CyberPunk. I said it many times - reading SciFi gives us a glimpse of possible futures. Many ideas later materialize in our world because of people who read/watched those books and movies. 

If you are a CyberPunk fan, you will enjoy it, but if not, you will want to glance at it - a [Dynamo Drema, a series run on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGZ_2RuJ2A&t=745s). 

​                      [ ![Dynamo Dream](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/4a2a0750e447d4f04f57c617f3c5f734b9e0c70b.jpeg) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGZ_2RuJ2A&t=745s)                    

Why I picked this one? Because of the quality of what a person on YT has  produced, which is on par with the quality of many productions delivered by names such as Netflix or big movie studios. We talk a lot about  creators' economy nowadays. Still, technology-enabled people produce  very high-quality content outside of what was considered an  entertainment industry. 

First streaming took over a TV and took over cinemas (COVID has accelerated  this one). The next step might be taking over streaming services or  delivering content to those with high-quality content. 

Dynamo Dream is an example of a trend to observe and a fun watch for Cyberpunk fans for a weekend. Enjoy it.

### Tools spotlight

It is not a "tool" as a standalone utility. Still, anyway, a lot of  developers and teams will benefit from it. Google has released an [Open Source Insight tool](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/06/introducing-open-source-insights-project.html) on the web. You can find it at [https://deps.dev/ ](https://deps.dev/) URL.

What Open Source Insight gives you is a look into an open-source module for:

- Security vulnerabilities and reports 
- Dependencies this library relay on 
- The license of the library and its dependencies. 

It supports npm, GO, and Maven modules at the moment, with Nuget and PyPi  "coming soon." I would want to see it as an API called from CI/CD  pipeline to verify project dependencies and, if needed, raise an  incident or create a work item for a developer to handle. Put it as a  part of the OODA Loop in the DevSecOps process.

Why is it important? Open Source grew to be a significant part of the  technology stack. It delivers value, but it doesn't come without  problems. Some of those problems are related to the model itself: how  projects are finances, how to maintain it, how to reward developers. 

Problems are on the receiving end. Companies don't know how to deal with Open  Source, and to be frank, it is also complicated. Developers throw OSS  libraries into the product and not thinking about the license of this  library or its dependency in the context of the customer. 

End customers don't even know how to handle it on their end - sometimes even don't have a policy they accept licenses. 

It creates a bit of limbo - things are happening but not at a conscious  level. It is worth to bookmark this tool and use it to verify OSS  dependencies you are using or someone delivered to you as part of a  product. 



That's it for this week Friday. I hope you found something useful for you to learn or enjoy. 

As usual, feel free to ask or comment, simply write to me. It is a source  of inspiration and also gives me an important signal, that someone is  out there reading.
