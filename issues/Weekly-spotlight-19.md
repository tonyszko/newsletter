# Friday's (Weekly) Spotlight #19

## The future and career with AI-assisted tools - case for Github Copilot

 

---



Hi

For the time being, I will rename this newsletter from Friday's spotlight  to "Weekly spotlight." Yet another place for a holiday destination and  caught by surprise with lack of network coverage :). Welcome good old  days of going to Internet cafes to get work done. 

All in all, that's good. I have more time to go over a book I pick up for  the holidays period. Here's a question for you: do you read other's  people book reviews? 

I know my pattern. I pick books based on people's recommendations, both  in-person (someone mentions something), online (blogs, articles), and  occasionally what shows in the Goodreads feed. I store them aside and  then pick one by one, checking reviews. The pattern here is that when  looking at a book, I typically look at "worst" reviews to determine  reasons why people dropped this book or why they found it uninteresting. 

Not something created intentionally, but I observed that I have this  pattern. So far, it works great (as always - my biased opinion). I don't look for reviews to tell me what's in the book but picking up the  knowledge of the crowd (interesting thoughts on how it works are in the  book "[Noise](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KQ2FKBX/)" I'm reading now) to refine my picks. Sometimes it gets me in strange directions. 

Now let's dive into last week - fewer links and resources, more technology  trend(s), observation, and thoughts around it. I hope you will enjoy my  stream of ideas around AI-assisted tools and a future of work with them. 

﻿﻿*Off-topic note* 

﻿﻿*Writing this e-mail, I observed a fly caught in the spider's net (seashore  countryside). What a beautiful display of nature, the cycle of life,  brutality, will of life, stillness, and the remainder of stoics virtues  in less than a minute. It was beautiful to observe and contemplate as a  daily reminder of things we are in control of.*

This e-mail is a bit long thread on the topic, so key points for you here:

- Evolution patterns created a new class of AI-assisted tools 
- Observe it, learn to use it efficiently - those will be standard tools in the future
- Using AI-assisted tools will become an everyday skill required in few years, not only in IT
- New practices and use patterns will emerge around it with new career opportunities. 

Let's dive into the technology spotlight of this week. 

​                                                                                                                                          

### Technology spotlight 

In a brief moment of checking what is going on in the world over last  week, one thing got my attention for sure. GitHub has released a GitHub  Copilot - an "AI" supported service to support developers in code  writing. 

Let's unload the gun from the start. Will "AI" replace developers? No. At least not in the short run (we talk years).

Why bother then? 

First - you might observe that I write "AI," not AI. Why? I'm not an expert  in this area, but I try to follow it. At least in what is available  right now to general use, there is not much "I" in AI. We have  algorithms that are good at specific tasks, and for those particular  tasks, those algorithms, once trained, works well. Sometimes  surprisingly well and fast. 

AI is everywhere right now in vendors and marketing jargon and hits the  ears of many execs looking to change something in their organizations.  It would be good to do a bit of reality check before going "all AI."

Now that said, I'm not saying it is useless. It can do a lot of things well and give good results. I am trying to stay realistic here and look at  it in practical terms. For sure, my thinking here is influenced by the  books I picked. If you are interested in a few, then "Life 3.0" ([LINK](https://www.amazon.com/Life-30-Max-Tegmark-audiobook/dp/B0742JQF31/)), "[Human Compatibile](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N5J5FTS/)," and recent "A thousand brains" ([LINK](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CDX6YNW)) will give you a good overview of why we are not even close to general AI. We might not be for a long time. 

Why bother with Copilot? 

After this semi-rant on the state of AI - why bother with [Github CoPilot](https://copilot.github.com/)? It is one of many services to come; probably, there are many such  services deployed already outside of my information bubble. From my  point of view, there are few reasons and things to observe.

- Future of AI-assisted work 
- Uncharted waters of AI-assisted work 
- Strategic use of industrialized components 

Future (at least close one) is AI-assisted, not AI replacing people

AI will not replace people, even when it will get much better at tasks it  can do. For a long period ahead of us, we are set to use AI-assisted  services. Github Copilot is an excellent example of such service coming  to the field of software development. 

﻿﻿**Let's say it: most of the code was already written.** 

How many times might you write a piece of code for a web page differently? 

Point taken, you can write it in many different ways, but is it an optimal  use of the human brain? A lot of code was written. What GitHub Copilot  does is tap into this pool of already written code and make things  faster. You can describe the task you want to achieve to "prime" the  algorithm, and it will pick the best match of it from already developed  code. 

There is no "I" in it. Github Copilot doesn't understand the code or task. It is doing what it was built to do and trained - building the best ending to what the developer started with the task description. Does it make  it less useful in what it does? No. 

It will get better at this task; the more people will use it, the more  people will refine its result. Every correction to the code generated by Github Copilot is an opportunity for the algorithm to learn.

Will GitHub Copilot provide some stupid code? Of course, it will. We should  see examples of it pretty soon on the Internet. Will it get better at  it? You bet it will.

If you think about it this way, it is a great tool. Collaborative tools  for developers, where each of them contributes to making it better by  using it, making it better for all other people using it are a great  idea.

AI-assisted tools like Copilot will get more common. This one is for developers,  but I bet soon we will see a version for cloud resources on Azure and  AWS. Most of the Terraform, ARM, or Bicep templates out there also were  already written. YAML configuration for pipelines is repeating some  tasks all over again. Kubernetes configuration consists mainly of the  same pieces. 

Getting Github Copilot to assist with cloud resources automation should be even easier than with code. 

What does it mean for your career and skills? Learn to use these tools. The  skill of using AI-assisted tools in your daily work will become on par  with all other toolings you are using right now. The ability to use it  efficiently, know how to prime an algorithm to get the results you want  and understand how to train it will be a future skill. 

It will also create a new set of work and skills focused solely on making  those algorithms better at what they do. It exists in Github and OpenAI  as a company at the moment, but this job will get to the mainstream as  well. 

GitHub Copilot is one of many services to come to commercial use. It is where  Google Translator or similar tools were back in the day. Maybe this one  will be a flop, perhaps it will create some stupid code, but it will get better, and you will use it daily. 

﻿﻿**Uncharted waters of AI-assisted work**

It brings us to an area we all will have to figure out: what to do with  such tools. Few questions which come to my mind immediately related to  CoPilot are:

- Who owns the rights to the code it provided if it is based on some pre-existing code? 
- Who will get paid for it? Will the income from it be shared with the original code creator? 
- What about security? What if code provided is  inheritably insecure, but through the feedback loop of developers will  get used widely/ 
- Can I tell Copilot what restrictions I want to apply (license, IP rights, security) to the code generated? 

The list can go on and on, but I'm sure you got it. Do I have an answer for it? Nope. Does Github? I don't know; I haven't read a lot about it yet, but we will need humans for those areas, and we will have to sort it  out. I'm sure Github did it in their T&C for a product, at least  from their liability point of view (the next service will be for  lawyers). Still, in general, as an industry, we will have to figure it  out. 

It can be a whole new line of work for people to ensure that such tools  are primed for a company's needs and regulations in those areas. 

Those questions are why we are not even close to when the algorithm will  replace humans in code development. It will assist you, but then you  need to do the work on your own to validate it and make sure it ticks  the boxes. Then feed it back to the algorithm to refine it.

Of course, people are not bothered with it and using the code provided as  it is. In the end, it is a tool, and we can't limit its use.

Github Copilot is an example of "move fast and break things." I'm sure they  limited their risk from a legal liability point of view. Still, there  will be a lot of discussion and debate around it, and I see sparks of it in my Twitter feed already. 

﻿﻿**Strategic use of industrialized components.** 

The last reason I took notice of Github Copilot is from the strategy point  of view. I briefly introduced the concept of Wardley Maps, where the  critical component is the pattern of evolution. 

Briefly: every component of a solution evolves from Genesis phase (oh, maybe it  can exist), through Custom (everyone builds its version of it), Product  (let's pick it up from the shelf) to Commodity (yeah, it works and I  don't think about it how). With the evolution of components, similar  evolution happens with practices around using those components. 

When components of a solution get into the product/commodity stage, people  figure out higher-level use built on top of them, together with  practices around it. 

Looking at the Copilot from this point of view, it is a case of precisely those patterns:

- Github built a code repository service with  elements around it based on pre-existing components (code repos existed  before) and commoditized compute services. Github also made on top of  practices around code development (CI/CD, Github flow, etc.).
- OpenAI developed on top of machine learning and  deep learning to create GPT-3 as a product. GPT-3 can be used for  different tasks in a narrow corridor of functions based on recognition  of text based on priming patterns. 

Microsoft took both products (Github and GPT-3) and delivered Copilot on top of  them. Copilot is somewhere between the Custom and Product stage and  triggered an evolution of patterns around AI-assisted code tools. 

From the evolution patterns point of view, the creation of the Copilot by  Github was the obvious next step (not this specific product but as an  idea). It was predicted years ago and pointed out in a different form.  It is also being created of conversational programming: using natural  language to prime the algorithm to build a solution for you. 

There will be more of such services, and they will evolve towards the Product phase. Don't be surprised to use a couple of those AI-assisted tools in the everyday job a few years from now and assume that it was always  like that. 

What is to be observed is what kind of new practices are emerging and where  it is heading. Why? Because it is where the value is for years to come  for your future career or maybe even starting a business. 

Evolution patterns are a great lens to look through, and I encourage you to learn more about them.

Will the future shape in the way I described in this e-mail? I don't know,  and the beauty of it is that nobody knows. There are maps, patterns, and predictions, and all of them are wrong in some way. All models are  wrong; some of them are useful. Good to remember that. 

I hope you enjoyed this stream of thoughts around emerging technology patterns in years to come. What
 are your thoughts about it? Different opinion? E-mail me with ideas, 
comments, or questions. Happy to read them and respond.

Bellow you can see exactly the place where it was created :). Not because it  is fancy place to work, but because it is the place where LTE had  coverage - it was gone one meter from this place in any direction. We  fly to the moon but we still don't understand mobile phones enough
