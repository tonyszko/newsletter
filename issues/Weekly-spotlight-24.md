---



Well, how it goes in one of the songs titles from Stained. - It's been a while. A couple of things contributed to almost a month's break in this newsletter. Summer holidays combined with a sudden failure in all my electronics almost cut me off for a week and a half from work (during holidays, so it was good). 

To be honest - at one point, I decided to not try to fight it (I could search for a working computer in a store nearby) and take it is. Sometimes you have to go with a flow :). The unforeseen (or actually expected) consequence of it was a break in the newsletter. As a side-effect, I moved to Windows 11 a bit earlier than planned. 

You have to accept my apologies and also accept it :). 



What was nice is that I got many messages from you with questions. Am I all right, and will this newsletter continue ... 

> Do you plan to send more of your e-mail spotlight? The last one I have is from 15 of aug and I really miss it!

> Hey, is everything all right? 

... and a few others over different channels. 

Thank you all for it, and it also gave me a kick in the butt to get back and start to write again. As always, the hardest part is to begin. Once I started this morning (and you have to believe me on this one), I had a smile on my face while typing it, and I felt good again that I was doing it. Now I'm back, and I plan to send those e-mails as long as you will be reading them on the receiving end. 

I'm thinking a bit about pushing this newsletter. I will pull your thoughts about it - expect a little to ask about your opinions soon. 

For now, here's the next Weekly Spotlight with my thoughts, links, and opinions from last week(s).



## Career choices 

In the last few months, I had a couple of conversations with people looking for a career change or direction at a different stage of their career. Last week, I participated in few job interviews (as a hiring person, not hired). I had a few thoughts after those thoughts, and it might be good to share them (some of those I already did in the past).

**#1 - At some point, it is more about lifestyle choice than a career choice** 

You were looking for a career choice to learn something new, develop a new skill, or change the environment. Earlier in the career, those are the main driver for a change. Later in the job, but nowadays even at its early stage, one of the main factors become a lifestyle choice. 

Simple example: *This week, I interviewed a person in a mid-career stage. Good job, good company, and all the boxes were ticked. Why was he considering the change of position? His company is looking to get back to the full, on-site office schedule. After over a year of working from home, he is not willing anymore to spend 2hrs+ every day on commute.* 

A lifestyle choice. 

It doesn't have to be about a commute and the office. It might be about your willingness to travel or how much time you spend working vs. not working. It might be your preference on hours (you prefer to work night shifts) or ability to travel. I interviewed someone who looked for a job to allow him to work while riding a motorcycle in Asia.

It might be your willingness to take risks of being without a job for a while for greater freedom or have peace of mind of full-time employment.

It is good to have an answer for yourself what is your preferred lifestyle choice and if what you do and how you do it supports it. 

If the answer is not, is it something that suits you at this stage of your life, or if not, what has to be changed to support it? 



**#2 - There will be a moment of choice of who you want to be for the future. It is a hard one**.

If you come as I am from a technical career, a good chance is that you developed it around some part of technical expertise. Then a world change, and you adjust. Take a new skill, learn, re-skill to the new platforms. That's the cycle, we strive to be up-to-date with what is going on in our industry. 

It isn't unique to our industry; the pace of change seems to be faster (not always is), but the same applies to all industries and careers in it. 

There will be a moment where you will face a choice - jump on the next technology change train, re-skill, get new certifications, etc., or maybe answer a question, "What man do I want to be?". Am I still a technology expert, or I'm more business, team, or project manager. 

It requires an honest discussion with yourself. The worst situation is if you don't want to be in this place anymore, but you will stick to it because of change-related fear. It is a straight path to burnout in the long term - you will be doing what you do, getting new certifications, and doing more advanced projects, but you will not enjoy it. 

It is good once in a while to sit with yourself and ask if it is a place you still want to occupy in the world. What helps is the realization of few things:

- None of this is permanent or final. You can make a change again or revert it if you don't like it. 
- It is something new, so you don't have to be perfect in whatever you decide to do from day ONE. Give yourself time and set expectations around it. 
- Only expectations you think you have to meet are set by yourself. The world doesn't pay that much attention to it. 

From personal experience, I know this choice is hard. I had to make it, and I did it. I'm not that deep technical anymore (but well, I still can lift few heavyweights in technical space), and I don't have a problem with admitting it. 

From my observation, a lot of people struggle with their daily reality because they haven't asked themselves and answered those two questions:

- What is the preferred lifestyle they want to have? 
- Are they in the position they want to be in this moment, or do they stick to what they build over the years? 

Having an answer to both helps make decisions around your career and life. 

That's it on my thoughts from this week and let's jump for what you were waiting for ... bookmarks, links, books, tools, and my opinion around it :). 



## Weekly spotlight 

### Bookmarks spotlight 

There is a lot in the bookmarks from those last few weeks. I don't want it to be a 20-page read, so I've picked those few for you to explore. 

**The Omert√† of Consultancy**

Consulting is a funny business if you will think about it. Many things might go wrong when you consider the different angles and the conflict of interest of the consultant, person, or organization who employees the consultant and the subject of the work. 

If the consultant's goal is to generate more consulting work and their work might result in actual removal of the need for this work - what incentive does (s)he has to propose the final solution to the problem? 

The article ["**The Omert√† of Consultancy**"](https://edgillespie.medium.com/the-omert√†-of-consultancy-bf26b116e3e0) is an author dealing with his own sustainability consulting industry. Even if it is about a specific consulting area, many of the points raised are valid in other areas. 

I don't know your point of view on the climate challenge - I'm more and more concerned with it. Still, at the same time, I don't think actions around us will make a change needed (skeptical about the gov and corp intentions and what is proposed as a solution, so to speak). In this text, an author points out that sustainability consulting might not be doing what is needed because (a) they need projects to exists, (b) the goal is not to make a change but to make customers feel better. 

When I thought about it broader, I saw many similarities to what I saw in business and technology consulting. A bit long, but the opinion is worth reading. 



**Let's Loot** 

Hard to make a move in the tech space at the moment and not hear about the crypto-assets. I wrote about NFTs before, and it looks that since then, NFTs space (or mania) developed even further with punk's and other personal profile pictures selling as high as $6M. Well ... 

... but here's something different and exciting. [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/).

Loot is a project which dropped randomized bags (virtual) of things with some properties to anyone willing to claim it. That's it. No story behind it, no company, no direction. Anyone could claim it (it went fast) and do something with it. 

Why is it interesting? Because people claimed those (with a hope for a profit for sure) and started to play with it, create guilds, games, and tinkering with a concept in many directions. 

For me, Loot is interesting not because it is on crypto and it is NFT based. It is an example, how future ecosystems based on crypto as technology might look like. I can imagine games engines that are using loot-like properties and things to identify users and build game mechanics. It also shows that if people are interested in something, and if you give them a tool, they will do things with it (community rocks). 

It might be my old sentiment of MUD player and author speaking here. I see more potential for interesting outcomes from projects like Loot than from the financial projects around crypto-assets. 

BTW - if you want to touch crypto space from a development point of view, there are funny, educational project [**Cryptozombies**](https://cryptozombies.io/) which guides you through basics in the same way as code.org does for kids with Scratch and other languages. 



**Education shift**

Speaking about code.org (if you don't know it, it is a platform with resources for educational purposes in computer science) - through this announcement, [**"Code.org curriculum now teaches AI to every student!"**](https://codeorg.medium.com/code-org-curriculum-now-teaches-ai-to-every-student-f4d09895be15) I found their [**Computer Science Discoveries**](https://code.org/educate/csd) course with [**their curriculum**](https://studio.code.org/courses/csd-2021).

Why is it interesting? As a parent of kids in primary school (Poland), I can tell you that what code.org builds here is way better adjusted and structured than what kids are taught in the traditional school system. And this brings us to the question of how the educational system will have to change to adjust to it. 

At first look, it is much better for a kid to go through this course (best in a class with a group, but also alone with guidance) than spend a couple of years in a traditional learning path in the school. 

Now it will pose a question to future students and employees. Should I go into an educational system or go the alternate path? Should I hire looking at credentials from the schools, or is it good enough if someone brings an online curriculum and proof of doing it? 

The educational system will be shaken in years to come in a big way. 



**A little follow-up on China**

In one of the previous e-mails, I linked and wrote a bit about [China's moves in education space](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-24/china-bans-school-curriculum-tutoring-firms-from-going-public. China is not something that will occupy your mind every day, but nonetheless it is IMO worth watching what this country is doing right now. 

Why? 

It is my point of view based on anecdotal reads and sources I reviewed, but China is going on a long-term experiment of its own path. Definitely, it is not following the direction of the "West." For us, from our perception bubble, those things might look like a crackdown on society. Yet, those changes are made with a different mindset and direction in mind, which would indeed not be accepted in the "West." 

China decided to crack down on kids gaming with its decision to limit the time kids are spending on the screen on gaming - ["**China Slashes Kids' Gaming Time to Just Three Hours a Week**."](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-30/china-limits-minors-to-just-three-hours-of-online-gaming-a-week) As an avid gamer in the youth, I would not say it was terrible, but here is a question: what is its long-time effect in its current form for the entire society. Someone in their gov decided that the product is not what they are looking for, and here is the result. 

In the other direction, Chinese technology firms are pledging to contribute $ billions to the "greater good" or society - ["China's **Alibaba to invest billions by 2025 for 'common prosperity**"](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/03/china-alibaba-to-invest-billions-by-2025-for-common-prosperity?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other). Again, something that would be considered oppression in our system but is a puzzle in a very long game. 

At the same time, even if it is still one of the biggest polluters globally, it looks that they are taking it seriously and investing heavily in improving their stance on it in a reasonable time. What will be the outcome? Hard to tell, but something to watch. 

I would definitely watch it and the result, so be prepared for the occasional "China" drop in this newsletter. 



**Video games as a way of cultural change**

If we are speaking about video games, Simon Wardley had an interesting thread on the role of video games in shaping a culture and society shift, which was later turned into an article. Here it is for you - ["**Those virtual battlegrounds ‚Ä¶ I lost my country, but I gained a big pile of virtual gold"**](https://swardley.medium.com/?p=feb3da18e0f0). 

As always thought-provoking and insightful, Simon raises the point that video games (and what is started to be named a metaverse) will be where the battle to shape our values and culture might play out. Commenting on the news on China limiting the time for kids to spend on the games, he provides a different view on the reason behind it. 

If you think China is simply reducing video game usage in children for reasons of addiction, I would suggest you consider that it is also limiting exposure to unfavorable beliefs. I'm quite certain it will also export its own beliefs in games.

The same fact, different interpretations. Definitely worth reading and thinking about it. 



**It's not what you read; it's what you ignore**.

As a quick throwback from the past, I found a link to Scott Hanselman's video - [**It's not what you read, it's what you ignore - Video of Scott Hanselman's Personal Productivity Tips**](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/its-not-what-you-read-its-what-you-ignore-video-of-scott-hanselmans-personal-productivity-tips). As a person who struggles to ignore things and filter what I read (I always want to read more :) ), I couldn't agree more. The video is from 2012 but still valid, and you may want to pick it instead of one of Netflix shows :) (nothing terrible with Netflix). 



### Books spotlight 

**Summer with history books**

Last few weeks (and even month) was more relaxed on my information intake. It also showed in the number of books read or listened to in this period. 

I've finally finished [**"Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945"**](https://www.amazon.com/Postwar-History-Europe-Since-1945/dp/0143037757). This one is a beast. It is almost 900 pages of a dense history of Europe (I started to write our continent, but some of you are not Europeans). At one point, I began to regret a decision to have it on Kindle and not as an audiobook. Still, in the end, it was better as it allowed me to go over it at a slower pace. 

Postwar is about Europe after 1945 ... the war is over, and ... everything else begins. It explained a lot about the dynamics between the countries over the years and how it unfolded into what we call Europe now. It was funny to read about the events I remember (communist time in Poland, communism fall in 1989'ish time) and compare it with my knowledge about it from this time. For me, it was a very interesting read. What was interesting is also to observe how much has changed since it was published in 2006. 

Postwar is not pure historical work, but it also explores the change and history through the lens of the culture - books, movies, music and how it was used to shape the culture and politics for the future. 

If you want to grab something for the long winter nights, it is recommended to read. 

The other pick, recommended by a friend, was also from the history shelf - [**"The Bomber Mafia: A Dream, a Temptation, and The Longest Night of the Second World War."**](https://www.amazon.com/Bomber-Mafia-Temptation-Longest-Second/dp/0316296619) I picked this one as an audiobook. If you are listening to audiobooks, I recommend it in this form as it is well delivered. This book explores an approach to the air fight taken by the US during the war, how it was influenced by the mechanical computer created in total secrecy by one person, and where it led the entire world effort. 

Besides the story itself, it shows how the thinking of a group of people might influence the faith of many others, the direction of the war, and the lives of many. Also, how hard it is to admit that you are wrong and continue what you are doing in good faith because you are in your own bubble (remember last time when I wrote that going out of your bubble is one of the hardest things for all of us?). 



**Strategy bookshelf**

If you look for something for your bookshelf, here is a list of books on the strategy which are worth reading combined by the community - [**"Strategy Books everyone should read.""**](https://community.wardleymaps.com/t/strategy-books-everyone-should-read/811) I've already ticked six out of twenty-nine from this list, so I will definitely add some of those to my reading list in the future. 



### Tools spotlight 

**No-code vs. Tomek - round one**

There is an ongoing discussion about whether it is a "no-code / low-code" time as we went over a no-code hype cycle a few times before. I don't have an answer to it and still looking through the vendors and what is done in this space, but ... 

... best way to have an opinion and do something is to tinker with it. I've started to explore automation for some of my tasks around producing the content and communication (this newsletter, podcast, some functions at the company) with available services and software. I'm exploring two tools right now:

- [**N8N**](https://n8n.io/): low-code integration platform available either as a hosted (SaaS) or self-hosted option for those who don't want to use SaaS. 
- [**Integromat**](https://integromat.com/): I found it through one of YT channels, and it looks really interesting as a platform. 

I am currently working on a simple workflow to save my time on everyday files, publishing, e-mail notifications, etc. I want to see if the effort put into it will pay off. Tools I use around it are, a typical stack at the moment - integration with OneDrive, MailerLite, Buffer, Obsidian, and Transistor. 

Looks promising, so you may want to take a look at it as well for your workflow. In some time, I will let you know about the results of my approach with no-code for simple tasks integration and automation. Stay tuned. 



**Docker - pay attention**.

Many of you might use Docker for personal use or at work. Pay attention to Docker licensing changes, which might require you (especially in your work setting) to [**purchase Docker for Desktop license this winter**](https://www.docker.com/pricing), where it was considered "free" before. Docker as a company is looking for revenue streams (something they should do). Still, there is a large outcry of the community of users, who consider it a move to take something away from them. 

Docker is an interesting case in the tech world. It is worth reading through [**the "How Docker broke in half"**](https://www-infoworld-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.infoworld.com/article/3632142/how-docker-broke-in-half.amp.html) article, which goes through the entire topic as a company and product. It looks like they fall a bit of a victim of the work they did pretty well on what they were doing. Anyway - Docker for Desktop: let people at your company know that you may want to check its licensing.







That's all for this week. I could keep it going, but then it would make this e-mail too long for many of you to consume in a time you can spend on it but also I want to save some things for next week.
