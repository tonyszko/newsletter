## ✋Measure of work well done, Feedback, Facebook down, Cloud over farms, McKinsey and middle class ... books and more 



---



Hi 



Another week passed by. This one went fast for me - sometimes there is this period of cumulation of things, and for whatever reason, the last quarter of the year is always like it. 

This year I started few initiatives, and it looks like I still keep them going. This newsletter, podcast, some learning on my private side, more organized running training schedule. One thought about it is that it creates a rhythm of things - every Sunday, write a newsletter and send it out. 

It is good to have it here and see that you are reading it, as it gives me a moment where I need to sit and think about what had happened last week, what thought's I had, and go through the week once again summit up. 

Exist (started to use it in recent weeks as I wrote in previous e-mail) seems to agree with this.

So far, it is anecdotal evidence - it is less than two weeks of data in it. I still use it, and I like it, but I'm unsure if I will keep it after the initial trial period. I am still deciding on this one. I will let you know in two weeks. 

Before the usual spotlight on things, I found two paragraphs on simple yet important things I thought about this week. 



## Measure of the work well done 

What constitutes a job well done, or how do you know you have done well in the long term? People measure it through various measures: wealth, influence, social media reach. 

It will be a story of a type you can find in management or motivational books, but it happened for real this weekend in my neighborhood. 

I live close to one of the city's train stations, and as usual in such cases, you can find many small shops there. One of those was a bakery shop - to be honest, I haven't been there. I rarely use the train to travel.  The shop owner decided to close it down (retire or go out of business, I don't know). He posted information about it on the shop's door. 

People around got to know about it, and they decided to throw a celebration for him. Random people, which had one in common - they were his customers. It happened this weekend.

That is an ultimate sign of success in what you did. Random people with whom you did small interactions over the years decided that you are an important part of their life experience. 

Whether it is running a bakery shop, doing IT services, or developing code, people will remember how you did it.  Does it always come with measurable success in the end, based on metrics like wealth, influence, and reach? I'm not sure, and in many cases, probably not. But if you can do it in a way where you are at least well off and at the same time touch people in such matters as this guy, I think that ultimately it is well delivered. 

This celebration for this guy is something I might never achieve :).  It isn't granted. But it is an ultimate sign that you did something good along the way. 





## The need for feedback 

I wrote about it once before, but IMO this message needs to be repeated. We all need to give more feedback, especially in cases where it is rarely given. What are those cases? Again, an example from this week. 

I spoke with one of my team members about the project in some trouble, and during the discussion, it was said about one of the team members: *He is a good engineer, needs some experience, but he is a good one.*

My next question was: *Have you told him about it?* 

The answer: *No, he knows it.*

No, he doesn't. And even if (s)he knows it, it needs to be said explicitly once in a while. 

You and I live in a competitive environment with high expectations. People expect that things will always be done well. We need to excel, do a great job. If it is done this way, perfect, life goes on. 

STOP. It is exactly a moment when we need to stop once in a while and say it explicitly - *It was well done.* *You are good at what you are doing.* *You are a sound engineer.*  

There is a need to point out good behavior and reinforce it with positive feedback. People need it, and they assume that they are good and doing a great job might be wrong. This person might beat themselves with some small mistake they made, which is probably not a mistake but something negligible. 

Why? Because the pressure around the IT industry and business are enormous. Success is everywhere (at least in what is presented), and expectations are high. In all this mess, we often forget to appreciate simple things. Job well done. We take it for granted. 

It is not. 

Think how often you've heard it and when was the last time you told someone that she/he is good at what she/he is doing. 





Now let's jump to the weekly set of spotlights. A collection of recommendations from weekly spotlight #28 is here for you. 







## Bookmark's spotlight 

Quite a lot of things this week, so let's make a hard choice and distill a few important (My PoV) or interesting for you. 

### Facebook is down; we have Facebook down.

They said Facebook was down this week. "They said" because I have carved out Facebook from my digital life and workflow almost wholly. Almost, means I do have some connection (few things on WhatsApp), but if it is not available, no biggie, life goes on. 

Facebook made their [**blog post about the outage**](https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/04/networking-traffic/outage/). Still, before that, I read a description of how the incident unfolded from Cloudflare's perspective - [**Understanding How Facebook Disappeared from the Internet**](https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/). Why is it an interesting post? Few reasons:

- The network is complicated, and few people (in the whole population group) understand its complexity. 
- With outages like this one, we are getting a ripple effect. Things are falling apart only because one piece failed. The ripples go through the system because of the user's actions and other elements taking the load. 
- It works at the level many do not even know about (routing protocols, large scale networks), and we take it for granted where it is not. 

The side effect is that many people realize how much their businesses and profits depend on Facebook. Will they drop it - nope, but I think it will give them something to think about. Own your platform if you can! 



### Authentication is complex; Authorization is on Zanzibar.

Old habits and interests die-hard - most of my professional career was around identity and authentication/authorization areas, and I still pick it up when spotted. Authentication is a way to prove that you have the proper credentials to grant you a given context within the application. Note I haven't said it proves who you are; that's another pair of shoes. Authorization comes later - when you have given context, what you can do with it. 

Over the last 15 years, we solved authentication pieces. We landed on few standards that gain adoption now (OpenID Connect, FIDO, verifiable credentials). In Authorization, we are still out in the woods. There is OAuth 2.0, but beyond that ... not much had happened. 

Auth0 is an interesting company in this space, and here they brought to my attention something I missed - [**Zanzibar: Google'sGoogle's Consistent, Global Authorization System**](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/). Auth0 is in the SaaS space and going after this piece with their [**Zanzibar.Academy**](https://zanzibar.academy/) learning site. Reading the Zanzibar whitepaper and exploring what Auth0 builds around it lands on my learning "to-do" list. Check it out; maybe you will find it interesting (it is a good niche for a professional career). 

 

### How McKinsey destroyed the middle class? 

If you haven't sensed this already, I have a bit critical view of management consulting. I haven't encountered it a lot, but through those few encounters and opinions shared by many people within my bubble, I have spotted a lot of value in it and lots of dubious value compared to price. That's my bias.

That said, here's a piece - [**How McKinsey Destroyed the Middle Class**](https://amp-theatlantic-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/605878/) exploring an interesting change in dynamics over a couple of last decades. Management is thought of and seen as a practice reserved to few. From the company floor to CEO seems not to be a story anymore, and the self-interest of management consulting companies might be one of its causes. 

Make your own opinion here. 



### Zalando - how they play the game

If you don't know what Zalando is, they are one of a few prominent startups from Europe (cloned US approach with success) in the retail space. Why talk about them here? Here is an attempt to explain how Zalando works and plays its game using Wardley Mapping principles and tools - [**Zalando, a Wardley map about how they play the game**](https://joapen.com/blog/2021/09/16/zalando-a-wardley-map-about-how-they-play-the-game/).

Wardley Mapping concepts are a powerful tool to think about companies and how they work. In this article, Joaquín Peña explores how Zalando is coming out of user needs and is using technology, open-source, sensing engines, and gameplays to beat the competition. Please take a look; it is visual (maps) and maybe will help you think in those terms about other players on the market or your company. 



### Manage Your Keys (cloud edition)

Managing sensitive material (keys, certs) is essential both on-premises and in the cloud. It always surprises me how many companies still struggle with it. The challenge grows with the number of credentials and materials to handle and the complexity of the solutions and cloud environments. 

Cloud Security Alliance created a good document, [**Recommendations for Adopting a Cloud-Native Key Management Service (PDF)**](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content-production.cloudsecurityalliance/m1nuf5kcr3lcf14tfdcum5ve9c0r?response-content-disposition=inline%3B filename%3D"Recommendations for Adopting a Cloud-Native Key Management Service.pdf"%3B filename*%3DUTF-8''Recommendations%20for%20Adopting%20a%20Cloud-Native%20Key%20Management%20Service.pdf&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJ7D6HHC2YHBAPZ2Q%2F20211010%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20211010T100246Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=f7b28b2431a02624805be1ac8cdc3bac2327b6b93ee927b2111b873710c1e208), with recommendations for those who need to handle such tasks. Not deep technical but rather overall guidance on how to approach it in a cloud environment. Suitable material for cloud architects and security people. 



### Stop using story points. 

Last week we had an interesting discussion within my team, and our Azure DevOps lead about story points. Conclusion - don't use it as an external metric within your project. I had this for a couple of weeks in a stash, but this makes it a perfect moment to include it in this e-mail - [**Agile Waste: Stop Using Story Points. Now.**](https://rigidity.medium.com/agile-waste-story-points-pt-1-a9df2572d0a3)

What is your take on it? If you are part of the development team, what metrics are you focusing on? (spoiler, check the books recommendation below)

### How big is a market around your location data? 

In this piece, you will find an answer - [**There's a Multibillion-Dollar Market for Your Phone's Location Data**](https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/09/30/theres-a-multibillion-dollar-market-for-your-phones-location-data). Spoiler is more significant than you may think, and players there might be other than you would expect - those are not social media companies. 

Location and data about us are and will be gathered in an ever-growing mass. There is too much value to extract from it in commercial terms not to try to squeeze it. The question is, is there a chance to regain our control over it. 

Currently, I don't see a solution on the horizon, so the only way to deal with it is to be aware of it and conscious about how we use our data and what data we provide. 



### Cloud over a farm? 

In the last weeks, I had interesting conversations about using cloud technology in farming. There is soo much going in this space, and if you don't look at it, you are missing it altogether. Luckily I had a chance to speak with someone who has more interactions and focus on this area, and he shed some light on it—expanding my bubble. 

After that, someone pointed out this article - [**Microsoft Predicts Weather for Individual Farms. DeepMC uses machine learning and AI to localize weather data**](https://spectrum-ieee-org.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/spectrum.ieee.org/amp/deepmc-weather-predicition-2655218179)**.** The fact that this solution comes from Microsoft isn't essential here (sheer accident). 

What does it tell us? Technology allows us to gather data about the local conditions in the agriculture and process it is already here. It can unlock a new way of doing one of the oldest things in humanity's history - growing food. 

I will watch this space a bit closer right now as I see a lot of potential for growing tech usage and the development of new practices and plays around it. 



### Metaverse is being pushed forward - whatever it is 

Facebook mentioned earlier is pushing its agenda towards " metaverse" - [**Facebook Launches $10 Million Maker Fund For Re-Branded Horizon Worlds**](https://www-forbes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.forbes.com/sites/charliefink/2021/10/07/facebook-launches-10-million-maker-fund-for-re-branded--horizon-world/amp/), this time trying to encourage creators to start to create worlds in its Horizon Worlds.

Will it create [a "Ready Player One"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One) type of world for us? I don't know. Almost two years ago, I started to watch this space, and it will take years to develop, but I think it will become a thing. How big? Hard to say. First time in many years, I will get a full-blown PC and start exploring more advanced use cases that can't work directly on Oculus devices. 

Technology lands here - compute power, advancement in image/video processing, even NFTs, which might make more sense in such an environment than in the real world. 

We need more players in this space as one thing I'm sure I don't want is a "Ready Player One by Facebook" world. 



### Let's geek out a bit - a technical bunch. 

I think I will start to use the previous week's approach and roll up a bunch of technical/cloud resources into a single section here. Here is the next pack; make your picks. 

[**Valise**](https://github.com/valist-io/valist) is an approach to create a de-centralized packaged repository. As per the project description, a *trustless universal package repository enables you to digitally sign and distribute software via IPFS in just a few steps*. As much as I like the idea, I can also see dependency management becoming a bit harder with this one. 

Azure [Cross Solution Network Architectures](https://github.com/nehalineogi/azure-cross-solution-network-architectures) is a GitHub repo you should bookmark if you work with Azure Cloud. The authors put so much work into gathering those solutions together. Suitable reference materials both to use at work and for education. 

[Azure Service Authentication and Authorization table](https://github.com/jsa2/aad-auth-n-z) is another report worth having in your bookmarks - *This table is provided for reviewing service authentication and authorization security in Azure – Especially cross-service security.*

Do you want to geek out into crypto-space? The massive resource [**Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contract Course – Beginner to Expert Python Tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ) is a **16HRS (yes, sixteen)** long video tutorial on a subject. If you want to get into this space, here is probably all you need to know to start and for free. 



## Book's spotlight 

I picked for this week a read from Michael Dell - [**Play Nice but Win: A CEO's Journey from Founder to Leader**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VWFW56N/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)**.** Maybe not everyone will get interested, it is a book about both, how Dell became a company and the history of it going private and public again. Michael Dell is a bigger-than-life business leader who started a company from nothing as an 18yr old kid and brought it to its current size. I don't think there is a person who touched computers who don't know what Dell is. 

I almost finished it and few interesting points:

- Michael Dell showed outstanding awareness of the environment he was operating in (awareness)
- Few mentions of IBM and Dell's interactions with this company from the book show that the culture brought IBM to the cloud problem I wrote about the previous week.
- There are a couple of good examples of how Dell focused on building a higher-value business. Others focused on commodities and perceived the company through this point of view. 

Interesting read, for younger of you also a good lens into how this industry become to be. 

It is not only about business, strategy, and geopolitical books on my bookshelf. Next in line is [**"Team Guide to Metrics for Business Decisions: Pocket-sized insights for software teams"**](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Guide-Metrics-Business-Decisions/dp/1912058812) recommended by Predica's new team member from the US who just joined us. Based on this recommendation, I look forward to reading it. 

I've finished [**"The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium,"**](https://www.amazon.com/Revolt-Public-Crisis-Authority-Millennium/dp/B07K6Y6KGZ/) full review will land on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39490736-tomasz-onyszko) and for you key highlights as a preview:

- Information technology has created a new balance between society (public) and governments. It gives a public (good discussion in the book what it means) a way to spark and communicate the ideas and organize
- It changes the dynamics between the public and governments (or center how it is called) and makes people question what was considered an authority in the world. 
- It has and will impact how the world is shaped and how ideas are spread, movements sparked, and governments react. 

I liked it as it puts in words dynamics we have been observing in the world for some time now. Does the book give any receipts? No, it is more the research with conclusions and some predications where it might go. I liked it; make your pick. 



That's it for this week. No new tools, no tips & tricks. As always awaiting your feedback, questions, random comments, ideas about what you want to read about in this newsletter. I try to craft it to give you good value for your time and attention spent on it, but it always can be better.

You know how it works, reply, and I'm just one e-mail away. 

I made a to-do list around this newsletter for minor improvements and changes. Expect it to come shortly, maybe not strictly in this order of appearance:

- An archive for you to be able to navigate to older issues and for new-comers to be able to read through (that probably happens first)
- A landing page for people to see what it is about. 
- Some form of community circle to communicate with you in a more direct way 
- Overhaul of an e-mail template and style - I have to admit that when I started, I accepted the defaults :) and I'm not always happy with how it looks, but it is good enough.

Anything missing on this list you would like to see personally - shoot me an e-mail. 



Now I'm going to enjoy this unusually long, warm, and sunny fall in Poland and have my Sunday run.
