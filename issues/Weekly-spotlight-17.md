# Friday's spotlight #17: 

## Things that worked for me to improve my life, career and almost everything else



---



Hi

This Friday's spotlight is a lighter one with a couple of reflections and  learning. As I wrote last week, I'm enjoying time off, both from work  and from the information influx. 

The latter because of holiday time, but the other factor is WiFi in hotels being crappy. It is an eternal mystery of the world: *how we can fly the ships to space and land them back, but universally WiFi around the globe at hotels is crap*. I write this e-mail by the pool not because it is fancy but because it is a place where WiFi works best :)

​                      ![Holiday WiFi spot](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/c1094c7f9b3ecb919f6ea7644622fdf54dbe9800.jpeg/5d1f96474182fbbd9e62016d0f5b87b68d99c8d4.jpeg)                    

Something puzzles me, but I would not try to fix it (it comes from the learnings I will share with you today). A question that popped up in my mind is,  "Are we architecting those buildings now, with a network coverage in  mind?". 

If you happen to be in this industry and know its answer, you can amuse me with it.

This week, instead of a portion of findings from the Internet and thoughts  about it, I will share my learnings and things I stopped/started doing  in recent years, which positively influenced my life and career. 

Why this topic? Partially because of information hiatus - it is one of those things.

Primary learning is - We make our world as we live it, and many things which  distract us or bother, are because of the way we decide to have it this  way. We choose to change it if we don't like it. 

The hardest thing - what if we are not aware that we don't like it and assume it is how it is, always been, or should be. 

***Every time you observe yourself saying "it is how it is," "it is how it  should be," or "it is how I always behave/do things," you should look  carefully at it and if you want to continue it.*** 



Here it is - Fridays' spotlight on what made my life better without  significant investment or effort (not always). Your mileage might vary,  but maybe you will find something you want to add or remove from your  life. 

​                                                                                                                                          

## Things I started/stopped doing in recent years, which influenced my life and worked for better



﻿**Limit information intake** 

There is an infinite amount of information for you to process. You can digest it and process it all the time, and there will be more.

The entire Internet industry is built on feeding people information. The  majority of it is noise, not to say junk. You can skip it, and nothing  will happen. Correction, if you miss it, your life will improve for the  better.

Internet and other people want your attention and want to feed you with  information. Being busy with ingesting it, you can't process, can't  think. You are being provided with opinions and facts, which are not  relevant to your life.

What's worst - this information is targeted to create a sense of urgency in  you. Hurry to be worried, scared, to act. Why? Because it pushes you to  consume more information. 

What I did:

- I don't watch TV for years now. I have a screen but no cable or other way of viewing "TV" programs in any way. 
- I block news sites in my browser and on my devices. 
- I removed all news or information apps from my devices.
- I (almost) quit social media. If I consume it,  never through the app on the phone/tablet and signing-out after use (I  know myself)

This change, done a couple of years ago, had a significant impact on me. It  released time and attention to focus on things that are worth the watch. What is more important - it removed this artificial sense of urgency  created by information intake.



In the end, it brings peace and stillness in your life and releases your focus to do other things (or choose not to do it).

***Try it. 
***

﻿***Limit your information intake for a week. Drop social media and news site,  do not follow TV stories. You will see a difference and you will find  out that you have not missed a thing (at least from important things)**.*





﻿**Adopt a stoic's way of thinking about things**

I will not pretend I'm a philosopher. I haven't studied a lot of it or  deep enough to discuss different schools of it. A while ago, I stumbled  on a book on stoicism and about/written by stoics, and it clicked. 

I adopted the main principle (in my own words): You don't control what is happening or other people's behaviors; you control how you react to  events and other people's behavior. Focus on it.

It taught me not to worry about things in the future or resent the past.  What is happening is now. I don't have control over what will happen  tomorrow or in a year from now. Why worry? 

To be understood:

- It doesn't mean you should not plan for the  future. Thinking long-term and doing things to accommodate it (a simple  example is insurance) will help you.
- It doesn't mean you have to be a passive  observer. Quite the opposite. It sets the area of focus on what you can  control and influence. 

Daily examples? Why worry about politicians arguing on new tax law. You can't influence it (unless you are part of a lobby group and your job). You  can't change it at the moment (at least in the Polish law system). It is not decided how it will look in a final form. 

Wait until it is in place (or at least committed), assess the impact on you  and your family, act. Don't be angry about it. You may disagree with the foundation of it. You might have your reason why it is terrible, but  being angry or debating how it will be bad for society will do you no  good. 

There are more examples, and you will find them around you:

- People who behave in a stupid (in our view) way or against common sense 
- Unreasonable behaviors at work and projects
- Kids are irritating you with their noisy behavior when you want to rest.

You can't change or control it. You can control how you react.

Summary in short:

- Focus on what you can control and influence, not how others behave or do. 
- The thing you have control on is how you behave and react to things. 
- Do not worry a lot about future events and what  "might" happen. Thinking long-term is good — me thinking about whether a week from now is a distraction. Think "now" more.

Am I always good at it? Nooo. Am I trying and observing myself? Hell yes. 

If you want an excellent introduction to this way of thinking, "[A guide to a good life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5617966-a-guide-to-the-good-life)" is a great book to start. ["Daily stoic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29093292-the-daily-stoic)" ([LINK](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29093292-the-daily-stoic)) is a book I keep on my Kindle handy to pick-up on random days. 

***Try it.***

***Next time you will spot that you are getting angry at*** ***some situation or experience negative thoughts, stop and think if it is really that bad or it is only about your reaction to it. You can change your reaction and it might not be that negative if you will stop  thinking about it in this way.*** 





﻿**Move. Sleep. Care about yourself.**

There is a moment in our life when we feel invincible. It happens in 20-the  30s. You can work all night. You don't need to sleep. You don't need to  change anything. 



It is always easier to be busy. Have one more thing to do, take on another project, fight the next fire. 

Nope. It isn't. Neglecting those simple things in the long term will harm  you. Taking care of it will do great things for you in a long time. 

If you want to pick some book about it, you can start with ["Why we sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep) ([LINK](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep))". You will find people disagree with its facts on the Internet but the bottom line from it holds. 

***Try it. 
***

﻿***Try to sleep at least 7-8hrs per night for a week. If there is something  urgent at the end of the day, leave it. Go to sleep early, wake up early after 7-8hrs of sleep. Do it. You will see a difference.***





﻿**Stop being busy** 



Let's face it. You can be busy as much as you want. World and people in it  will always put more on your plate. There is always more to be done. And here you are as a filter. 

Learn to say "No." 

​                      ![Say no more often](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/3bcfd1590289cad79ddcb31d81a4df9b5b6b8da1.jpeg)

Saying "No" when people approached me to do something was a thing I had to learn.

"Will you speak at my conference?" Why not? It is a 45-minute talk, how bad can it be. There will be an audience. "NO"

"Will you write an article for us?" Hmm .. "NO." 

"Do you have five minutes to take a look at this?", hmm "NO." 

The last one is hard in work settings. If you are good at something, people will want your opinion. If you are not good, but people think you  influence this environment, they will enjoy it even more (no better  excuse than "He said that"). 



​                                                                                                                                          

As you can see, no magic tricks here. No tools or wonder techniques that  will solve your issues in five easy steps. There is plenty of such lists on the Internet. You can find steps to follow successful people to  become (?) them (?).

**In a nutshell:**

- **Limit information intake and distractions coming with it**
- **Control what you can. Act for "now," think long term. Accept things that are happening for you now.** 
- **Move, sleep, take care of yourself**
- **Stop being busy.** 



I found out that you don't need magic tricks. You need to address the  artificial sense of urgency created by others, think about where to  focus, and care about yourself. It is best what you can do.

Of course, I have tools and tactics to fight my weaknesses or optimize my  workflow besides the general attitude. It is more workbench for daily  life. Those things in this e-mail are my general framework for acting to stay sane, enjoy life, and do exciting things.

Till the following Friday, I'm getting back to my holiday.

Enjoy your weekend, friends.
