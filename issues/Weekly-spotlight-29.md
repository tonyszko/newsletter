# Weekly spotlight #29: 

## Hiring fast 💨 or slow🐌? SPECIAL⭐ announcement, emerging tech, armed robots ... and more



---



Hi,

I hope you are good! Here's a bit delayed Weekly spotlight but again,  I've decided quality over quantity when the time was squeezed a bit. 

This week I brought to you my thoughts on hiring process, SPECIAL newsletter announcement and usual set of links, resources and books to process. It is packed so let's jump right into it. 



## Hire fast or slow? 

It came out as a topic in a LinkedIn discussion. Should the company have a long, multi-stage recruitment process or hire quickly and evaluate on  the job. In a nutshell, this boils to two choices:

﻿**Hire slow and fire fast, or Hire fast and fire fast.** 

What is your opinion? Do you prefer a long process where you can decide  about your fit for a company you join, and the company can determine if  you fit well or hop on the job and see if it pans out? If not, jump to  the other spot? 

Here's my point of view - again biased by my bubble:

- Previous experience
- The current job at my company
- Mainly being a hiring person for the last twelve years 

When I'm looking to hire someone, it means two things for me:

- It creates a commitment between this person and the company
- Am I looking for a long-lasting relationship between this person and the company? 

Why? If you haven't thought about it before, hiring is one of the most  crucial processes in a company and the most expensive one. 



### Why is it crucial? 

Hiring and joining a company establishes a relationship and creates a  commitment (of course within the work agreement) from both sides. I'm (a company) deciding that you bring value to the company, and we are  looking for a long ride together. At the same time, I (a company) commit to fulfilling my duties in this relationship. It also creates some  expectations - how you will fit into our environment, apply your skills, what value you will make for a company. 

You (hired person) make an important decision to change your work  environment. Why is it important? It affects more than only your working time. It involves the mental well-being, well-being of your family (if  you have one). It might be a boosting step in your other career, or it  might put you in a weak position for the future (if it will not pan out, and you will get stuck there). 

It is a two-way relationship with an entangled web of dependencies,  commitment, and expectations on both sides. What is essential here  applies to both sides, and both sides have a saying to start and end it. 



### Why is it an expensive process? 

It cost a lot of money for sure. Hiring is not only the interview you are  participating in and the time spent on it. From a company perspective,  it has more ingredients that create the financial cost:

- Scouting: finding as many suitable candidates as possible for this position 
- Initial review: deciding who meets the initial bar of the requirement 
- Interview(s): it takes time, typically from the best people in the company 
- Onboarding: if a company takes it seriously,  onboarding is more than a single meeting at the beginning, and it takes  several weeks (different activities at this time)
- Integration: integration of a new person into a  workflow and team takes time. During this time, the company has to  assume (as it is true) you will not perform fully in your role. It is a  cost company has to ingest. 

Those are financial costs (not all of them), but another side of the price is a toll on the team. It puts a toll on the team if the person who joined went through the onboarding and integration process departs quickly. It takes a toll on their time, morale, and feelings (they always give you  an open slate, and typically you befriend them a bit).

The cost (financial and moral) of off-boarding a person from the team and  the strain it puts on the team itself is, in my opinion, one of the  biggest pains related to mishiring a person. 



### Hire slow, fire fast 

Because of all of the above, I'm all for the slow hiring process. It takes time for the company to build an opinion (not get to know) about the  candidate and their fit into a role. It takes time for a person to  decide (not get to know) about the new company, environment, and team. 

A recruitment process is where both parties can meet, evaluate and build  opinions about possible fit for the long-term relationship they are  about to enter. This process has to give both parties the feeling are  they share the same values and approach to this relationship. 

Skill? Yes, we also evaluate skills. In many cases, you meet the minimal bar  from a skills perspective if you get to the interview stage later than  the initial screening call. 

Fire fast? 

Yes, I'm all for it - if it doesn't work, it is better to part ways and look for new relationships. What does it mean "it doesn't work"? In most  cases, it is not about the skills but about the fit at the values and  team level. 

You rarely have a person who doesn't meet the bar for technical skills  after the screening process. Technical skills can be thought and rather  quickly. If it comes to "fire" or "quit" (both sides has said) decision, it primarily is based on:

- Lack of fit at the values level 
- Lack/lost trust 
- Lack of personal fit at the team/company level (primarily because of lack of values or lost trust).

In such a case, it is better to part ways than to drag this relationship as it takes a toll on the entire team involved. 



### What does it tell me if the company is hiring fast? 

In a discussion that started this thoughts stream, some people advocated  for a fast hiring process - one interview, and it's done. What does it  tell me personally? They are not in it for a long-lasting relationship.  For whatever reason, they are looking for quick onboarding and  off-boarding of people. 

Maybe they are in the outsourcing business and look for staffing positions at customers without actually making you an employee (despite contract)?

Maybe their work environment is not designed to build that relationship, and they accept it as a cost of doing business? 

It gives me a warning sign for values and environment at this company, and that would be a solid signal to not start this process at all. But  that's me - what about you? 

﻿**Hiring is the most essential process for companies and you as a person looking for a job. Pay attention to how it is performed and how companies do  it, as it tells a lot about the culture and values inside of the  organization.** 

Any question on it? Any experience you want to share with others? Drop me an e-mail or discuss it on [the GitHub discussion board](https://github.com/tonyszko/newsletter/discussions) (what board?? Keep on reading).

## Tip of the week

Let's try something new - sharing what I started to do or stopped to do. Not a regular lifehack, but sometimes you do the simple thing, making your  life easier or free some of your time. This week I deal with the inflow  of ... newsletters. 

Over time I've accumulated many newsletters through sign-ups, product  download, you name it. Every morning I simply deleted those from my  Inbox (landed primarily on "Other" Inbox so "Select all" and "Delete").  This week I thought that it was stupid. It takes me some time every day. 

Instead of that, I started to Unsubscribe from them. Yes, it takes a bit more  time, but at the same time, it cleans things once and for all. 

In its process, I stumbled on this one (screenshot below), which showed  how bloated this entire process became and how UX matters. It is an  "Unsubscribe" page from Dell, and it is ... bloated. 

​                      ![Dell subscripotion unsubscribe screan with a little bloat on it](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/61ce38c1f04d16b504a89fa8067632d5da9f5acc.jpeg)                    

It literally took me a minute or so to figure out where I should click. If you are doing UX at your job, please don't do it like this one. Think  if you want to start doing the same, and I hope this newsletter will not be part of your cleanup process. 

﻿*I promise to have new tips for you every week, but I will share new  things I do, don't do, or find out more on process and decisions level  than tools.*

​                                                                                                                                          



## Announcement: Newsletter archive 

Some of you asked about it, so here it is. I've taken the previous issues of this newsletter and put it in a single place as an archive. I've  decided to put all the possible choices of tools for it on GitHub😀.  Geek is strong in me. Possiblylosing all possible SEO and analytics  optimization. 

[**>>> Weekly spotlight newsletter archive GitHub repo !!! <<<
**](https://github.com/tonyszko/newsletter)

If you have joined later maybe, you will find something interesting for  you in old issues. Perhaps you want to have a bookmark to one of those  e-mails or share it with someone not signed up for it (their mistake).  Here it is for you for all those use cases and more. 

​                      [ ![Newsletter archive on GitHub](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/545308d049284ec3cd2a394923b9fde1f27299e5.jpeg) ](https://github.com/tonyszko/newsletter)                    

Content will be updated with a slight delay - a week or two. I'm working on  automating this flow, so there might be some glitches here and there,  and the readme needs a bit of polish, but it will happen in the  meantime. 

If you are a GitHub user and want to correct something, feel free to use Pull Request. Any comments or discussions - [we can talk about it there as well](https://github.com/tonyszko/newsletter/discussions). Let's see where it gets us. 

If you like this repo, you can also "star" it.

## Bookmark's spotlight 

Again, so many to choose from. Here's this week's selection of things, news, opinions I've read and processed for you. 

### Emerging Technology Roadmap 2021-2023

It was released some time ago, and I kept pushing it forward, so now is time. Gartner released their version of "radar" for [**Enterprise Technology roadmap between now and 2023**](https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/publications/documents/le-emerging-tech-roadmap-2021-2023.pdf). 

​                      [ ![Gartner's Emerging Technology Roadmap 2021-2023](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/ece68c0c69f34e7fd21d7265e215c6f6381a439b.jpeg) ](https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/publications/documents/le-emerging-tech-roadmap-2021-2023.pdf)                    

I have my skeptical view and opinion on consulting companies like  Gartner, this takes, however, is interesting to take a look at:

- It is another data point for your overall picture of where tech is heading. 
- It puts perspective on some areas that are  considered hot at the moment. Still, adoption might actually be delayed  in time (I observe the same).

Take a look, don't take it at face value; make your judgment. I found it interesting. 



### China, U.S., A.I. and the battle for dominance 

This headline made a splash in last weeks - [**China has won A.I. battle with the U.S., Pentagon's ex-software chief says**](https://www.reuters.com/technology/united-states-has-lost-ai-battle-china-pentagons-ex-software-chief-says-2021-10-11/). As with every headline, read what's in it and be skeptical about the message from the headline itself. 

This one is interesting, as it comes with a person with credentials and a  broad view of what the gov and military are doing vs. other countries.  It says that without change of course and approach, China is now and  will be ahead of the U.S. in this area. It calls for action, which might turn around this tide but also realistically says that it will take  10-15 yrs of effort to make it. 

Interesting point of view in a geopolitical and technological context. Another data point to make your own judgment. 



### I.T. landscape maturity model 

Sebastian Gębski from the No-Kill Switch blog (one of the blogs I read every  week) released his point of view on the maturity of I.T. landscape - **[(My) I.T. Landscape Maturity Model](https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/my-it-landscape-maturity-model/).**

I pretty much agree with his opinions and approach here. It isn't  something scientifically rigorous but lets you orient yourself in a  broad sense where your current market is and what might be the next  phase of it. Worth reading.



### Carbon emissions footprint and who will meet their goals.

Here's a summary of current global emission of CO2, consumption of coal, and  target goals for top polluting countries in this area (E.U. is treated  as a region here) - **[The Graphic Truth: Net Zero — What are the top polluters promising?](https://www.gzeromedia.com/the-graphic-truth-net-zero-what-are-the-top-polluters-promising)**.

​                      [ ![Net Zero](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/3556eac1078d5e921316f6c9607708f1acb5fe2c.jpeg) ](https://www.gzeromedia.com/the-graphic-truth-net-zero-what-are-the-top-polluters-promising)                    

Who would you bet on in this table to meet this goal at the date they set  for it? I have my bet - try to guess which one. What is yours? 



### Survival of the richest

Why speak about emissions, climate, and the goals? Because it will affect  us more and more in time. You may have your opinion here, but I also  have mine and will express it here. Things will get worst. Gradually  over time but at the moment, we are heading into not so rosy scenario. 

What do the richest do about it? They think about how to escape it and the  consequences of getting ugly because of climate change - **[Survival of the Richest](https://onezero.medium.com/survival-of-the-richest-9ef6cddd0cc1).**

I'm not calling to revolt against the wealthy class, but you should observe what is happening around you. Many people in the upper wealth range are (in my opinion) trying or assuming that they will be able to escape the consequence, so they do nothing or bet on some miracle technology to  happen. 

Will it? I don't know, but it is a risky bet. 



### What connects A.I., rich people, and climate? Armed robot

It had to happen. Boston Dynamics created designs we all know of robots  who can walk, jump and dance. Among those robots, one seems to be  particularly useful in some scenarios - a dog-like, four-legged support  robot. Once the design is out, someone had to have this thought - why  not put the gun on it. Here it is - **[They're putting guns on robot dogs now](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726111/robot-dogs-with-guns-sword-international-ghost-robotics)**.

​                      [ ![S.W.O.R.D Armed robot](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/2370ad29f6a4ce0580e0a4e58dd52573d77f331f.png) ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CU6th_qL7up/)                    

How does it connect with climate change? Krzysztof Daniel, on his Twitter,  made a good remark (it is not a quote, my version of it): *what if  those robots will not be used by the army. Still, it will be used to  protect people who want to avoid the consequences of climate change and  shortages and can afford it.* It sounds like a Mad Max scenario but not that unlikely, or at least I do not assign to it zero % probability. 

In the context of this robot, I also recommend a book - **[Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/40180025-army-of-none)**.



### When your boss is an algorithm

Here's another piece related to changes triggered by technology in our life - **[When your boss is an algorithm](https://www.ft.com/content/88fdc58e-754f-11e6-b60a-de4532d5ea35)**. 

I wrote a few times recently about the gig economy and algorithms used in it and also about management consulting and how it (see GitHub archive  for it if you are interested) affects the way we manage companies. 

This piece from Financial Times is about those topics - algorithmic  management, what it brings, and how it affects the gig economy workers  and not only. 



### Where is the limit of surveillance - Moscow goes all A.I. for ticket systems. 

Moscow decided to go full-on A.I. and image recognition for the metro ticketing systems - **[Privacy fears as Moscow metro rolls out facial recognition pay system](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/15/privacy-fears-moscow-metro-rolls-out-facial-recognition-pay-system)**. Convenient for metro travelers who will decide to use it. 

What's the problem with it for those who don't want to use it? You can't  opt-out. Of course, you can at a technical level and decide not to use  the system. Still, in reality, you don't control it, so it is one big  surveillance machine targeted to track people using the metro system. 

Would you welcome such a solution in your neighborhood? Would you use it? 

What will be interesting to see in a moment is what tactics and techniques  people will start to use to prevent that. Face painting, 3D masks  disrupting the image recognition patterns - figure it out. I'm sure it  will go mainstream in Moscow among part of the population, and the  government will fight it. 

This week fewer tools or directly technical content, more on the  intersection of technology, society, and what is going on around us. I  hope you like it and you will find something for you to read in it. 



## Books spotlight 

This week I've picked up something which was a long time on my reading list - **[Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track](https://staffeng.com/book)**. Gosh! If you are in tech and aiming for a senior, technical leadership career path, but if you are not, do yourself a favor. 

**>>> Go and read this book now! <<<** 

It explains in a consistent form, what I tried to name or explain what I  think is my job right now. Really, just get it and put it in front of  your reading list for this year.



​                                                                                                                                          



That's it for this week, folks. As always - if you want to give me feedback or any question, drop me an e-mail or use the GitHub Discussions forum  (new!). Always happy to connect with you.
