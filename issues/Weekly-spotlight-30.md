## Meta explained - why it is an escape move.  What APIs are used in the cloud? Lawyers and code ... and more



----



Hi

This week a fall in Poland was generous, and we had and still have when I  write it beautiful sunny weather in the upper range of +15C  temperatures. Pretty awkward if you were raised here as I did 40+ yrs  ago. Typically it should be a bit below zero and first snow out there. 

â€‹                      ![Atumn in Poland](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/298e3719d199fe9fafa315a8ed21f4ee35a4dbf8.png)                    

Looks like I'm getting into the "in my days" category. Still, what we will  need more in upcoming years is an adjustment to changing conditions as  it will happen. As you can see from a couple of last e-mails, getting a  bit more concerned about what is happening around us. No doomsday  scenarios planning (OK, a bit of it is always a good thing to do) so  far, but concerned more. 

To not get into a gloomy mood with such weather outside, let's jump into this week's installment with my point of view on Meta. 

**Don't you know what Meta is?**



## Technology spotlight: Why Meta and what it tells about Facebook? 

Facebook has changed its name to Meta. Not a website, but the name of the parent company which owns all the assets like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram,  and probably many others I can't name. The same had happened years ago  with Google being renamed to Alphabet. 

â€‹                      ![Mark Announces rebranding to Meta](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/9826559211ba75dc95843376999fcc73d39cc363.jpeg)                    

One thing to be noted as a difference between Meta and Alphabet change - in Google's case, it was also a moment where original founders passed the  baton to the next CEO. In the case of Meta, it is still Mark Zuckerberg  leading the entire ship on his own. If you haven't checked it earlier,  he has total control of a company because of its shares structure. 

Why Meta? Why now? Here's my uninformed, biased take. You are reading it at your own risk, but as usual, I have an opinion, and I'm not afraid to  use it. 

### Facebook: a company without a platform

Why Meta and why now? It is an offensive move by the company with the  future in danger. Facebook (Meta now) is trying to create a lot where it will have a future and escape the current duopoly of platform owners,  namely Apple and Google. 

Meta (Facebook) has applications and money-making machines. That's given.  The number of Facebook, WhatsApp, and its money-making Instagram users  provides a company with a solid foundation for now. What is the problem? 

To monetize those users, you need to have a way to access them.  Remember - Meta is selling users and their attention, not products - all their  products are free except for users. Facebook has apps all over the  platforms, but it doesn't have **A PLATFORM**. 

Why is it an essential distinction? 

To access users and be able to monetize them, you need to gather  information about them. Facebook has been very good at it since the  beginning. Still, currently, two major platform players, Apple and  Google, are concerned about their share and are using users' privacy as a differentiator for themselves. 

Apple introduces a requirement for applications on their devices to display  the information it gathers and users to opt-in into this, with  opting-out being a default choice. As it turned out, not many users are  willing to opt-in to this even despite all the tactics apps are using to convince them to do so. 

This move from Apple cut Facebook from a large portion of data they were  gathering about the lucrative market of iOS users, and it was seen in  Facebook's profits. 

Google owns two other platforms: Android OS and Chrome browser. In theory,  both are Open Source, and Chrome is not the only browser out there, but  with ~70% market share, it is the only browser out there :). Google is  making changes to the cookies and tracking mechanism in Chrome which  will do what iOS change did on the Apple side - cut Facebook off from  the user data. 

â€‹                      [ ![Browser market share](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/4667401ec0a159e206f27d84f87cb8e2787d0ffc.png) ](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share)                    

Of course, Facebook will try to fight it and figure out technical ways,  but there is only as much you can do without owning a platform. Facebook doesn't have a platform, and because of it, it doesn't control the  supply chain of its goods - users. 

### Users' pipe is drying out. 

Not controlling the platform is one - they still own the apps with billions of users, right? Yes, but ... there's always but. Facebook users are  getting old! 

In 2021 fastest-growing demographics for Facebook were people aged 65 and  older. At the same time, the segment which contains Millennials (young  people) rose less than 2%, and people considered as Gen X (actually my  age) decreased by 2% (*Source: 30 Essential Facebook Statistics You Need To Know In 2021*) 

It tells us that the user pipe for Facebook is drying out. Young users  choose other platforms - TikTok, Snapchat, and probably many others I  don't know about it. Recent papers disclosed by a Facebook whistleblower show that this change is the company's biggest concern. It tried to  reverse this trend. Still, so far, it hasn't worked that great for them. 

What's the problem with drying pipes of new, young users? Over time there will be fewer and less valuable (in monetary terms) people on the platform.  Today's kids will be future teenagers, and they spend a lot and set the  trends. With that, the value of Facebook goods (sorry, users) will  decrease over time. 

Harder to get to (no platform), fewer and fewer users in categories spending less money .... smells like trouble. 

### Speaking about the troubles 

One thing you can say for sure about Facebook is that it doesn't have great publicity at the moment. It is deserved. Facebook is currently getting  hits all over its reputation for its past actions and in-actions. All  news that surfaced recently is building the company's image, which is  hard to be liked. 

Selling users' data as its primary product, putting profit over the users -  this is a narrative built in the recent days. It is subjective how you  feel about it. I discussed this subject with my friends, and they didn't seem to be bothered. Personally, it is troubling, and I decided a long  time that there is no value for money (data) on their products, and I  quit it. 

### Escape velocity to the metaverse 

What can you do when you do not own the platform, new users are not flocking to your apps, and your name is on headlines every day? You can fight it or escape to the future. It is what, in my opinion, Facebook is doing  with its rebranding to Meta and announcements on focus on building the  metaverse. 

â€‹                      ![Time to abandon the ship](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/87f0ca6148ab35e72fa9fb1d6d15c02a7ac2987d.jpeg)                    

What is metaverse? Nobody knows at the moment? Some ideas are being thrown  around connecting VR, augmented reality, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs into something new. This new platform should create a whole new environment  for users and further economic benefits for many. 

It might be like it. Or it might turn out to be more like Ready Player One or Snowcrash (which actually coined the metaverse term) worlds. Those  two are not so nice to be in unless you have plenty of resources. 

With the company rebranding to Meta, Mark Zuckerberg tries to create a  future where Meta is better positioned to win and earn money on users.  Why? 

It will control the platform or critical elements such as hardware (Oculus and announced new projects) and user data (reported identity approach  to span across multiple accounts and apps). Once Meta has it in control, it can find a new position on the market and ditch the current apps,  with all its negative associations. 

Will it succeed? I don't know; time will tell.

Do I think metaverse will happen? I still don't know what metaverse is,  but some version of it will happen. It is already here with platforms  like Roblox or Minecraft (to a lesser extent) and technology  capabilities behind crypto-currencies. 

Do I want Meta to own it? Hell no! The last thing I can envision for my  kids is a metaverse controlled by a company such as Meta. For a variety  of reasons. I prefer metaverse based on distributed identity and secure  enclaves for data owned by the users with open protocol to exchange and  share it. 

The building blocks are out there, and I hope they will get connected in something which will not be controlled by Meta.



### What does it teach us? 

What all of it teaches us? I have two points for myself: 

- **First**, technology and  business-related - those who control the access to users and their  information (platforms) will win over the long term. It also applies to  companies that control other types of platforms, think about media  distribution, infrastructure, and areas with similar dynamics. That's  why Amazon puts its website and Alexa in front of the users, as it gives them not the seller's control over the platform.
- **Second**, more personal and  career-related - you have only one reputation. Pay attention to it, as  it is easier to rebrand the company than rebrand you as a person when  things go south because of your actions. 

This time it is more an opinion piece than the hard fact analysis, but maybe in one of the subsequent e-mails, I will draw a map of it (of course,  using Wardley mapping). Let me know if you find such opinions on the  changes in the world and technology useful for you or at least  interesting. 

Now, let's jump into the weekly selection of things I have spotted, read,  watched, and selected for you. Weekly spotlight at its best.

â€‹                                                                                                                                          



## Bookmark's spotlight 

### Save Leadership from leadership people. 

Here's a Medium post that tackles the leadership topic [**We Need to Save Leadership from the Leadership People**](https://journalofbeautifulbusiness.com/we-need-to-save-leadership-from-the-leadership-people-ba5dffec590d). 

What is Leadership? In this piece, the author proposes replacing all kinds  of Leadership mentioned in business books with the good boss. 

***(...) We need more good bosses, and fewer people in positions of authority  who are in it for the perks, or who aspire only to a Big Meaningful  Title.\** (...)\***

Interested? Read the whole piece.



### What is Glue? 

Last week I recommended a "Staff Engineer" book. In this book, a lot is a  need to do "glue work" in the organization. I stumbled upon this term  some time ago, and I liked it, as it describes many things I do on my  daily job, and I see a need in every organization. 

What is the "Glue"? Read about it in this piece - **[Being Glue](https://noidea.dog/glue)** by Tanya Reilly. 

Understanding what "Glue" works are and the need for it is one of the crucial  elements of advancing in a technological career. That's my opinion and  influenced by the book, already so eager to hear what you think about  it.



### What APIs are used in the cloud? 

Have you wondered what APIs are used the most in the cloud? I haven't until I have stumbled upon **[this dashboard](https://exploratory.io/dashboard/PQd2wHB2BZ/Multi-Cloud-EMA-Dashboard-sjX9acK2zH)**.

â€‹                      [ ![Multicloud API Usage dashboard](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/99c8f65e0dbe17a6fcab731c043cb2e5ab374ec5.png/c110ed3995a1b1073a04736b8a3ed0a96c216d79.png) ](https://exploratory.io/dashboard/PQd2wHB2BZ/Multi-Cloud-EMA-Dashboard-sjX9acK2zH)                    

Any surprises for you? You are still wondering if serverless is a thing?  This dashboard gives some clues to what people are building on. It also  confirms one of my own thesis from the past: people do beautiful things  on top of simple services like storage (check storage services).



### Storage from Cloudflare 

Speaking about storage, one of the exciting companies in cloud space is Cloudflare. They have recently released R2 Storage - **[Announcing Cloudflare R2 Storage: Rapid and Reliable Object Storage, minus the egress fees](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-r2-object-storage/)**.

If you are building for the web, you should pay attention to what  Cloudflare is building. They bet on a different computing model, focused mainly on the Edge. They release an exciting set of services and  capabilities.



### Get a coin for scanning your iris? 

The crypto-currencies world is in full swing. As I mentioned a couple of  times, I'm more looking for this tech to be used in a long period than  what is currently happening with a run for the money on the coins  itself. You will see some information about it now and then here, as I'm trying to educate myself and look at it from many different angles. 

"World coin" made headlines this week - **[Sam Altman's Worldcoin wants to scan eyeballs in exchange for crypto](https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/sam-altmans-worldcoin-wants-to-scan-every-humans-eyeball-and-give-them-crypto-in-exchange/) with a concept that made me a bit scary**. 

The idea is not that scary - give people a coin, distribute it and then see how it takes a world and becomes a worldwide currency. The take here is that people get the cash by signing up to the app, which is also a  wallet, and then they can use it. 

What caught my eye (in this case literally) is how this project approached  the "identity" problem. They are scanning a person's iris as part of the on-boarding process and assigning it with the wallet's identity. Makes  sense, but it is, in my opinion, a privacy nightmare. 

Folks who are doing it are probably much smarter than me and thought about it in the design. Still, I would not want to have a wallet attached to my  identity with all its history forever without the ability to erase it or change it. It is what is being created here. 

I'm not sure this project will fly as expected, but all such ideas create a bit of a creepy outlook for our digital future.



### Education is changing 

In one of the past installments, I mentioned China making a move on their  educational system to create more equal access to education within the  society. A sign of change in a similar direction is coming from the  other part of the globe - **[Amherst College Drops Admissions Advantage for Children of Alumni](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amherst-college-drops-admissions-advantage-for-children-of-alumni-11634731200)**.

If you are from a country other than the US, you might not see the issue  as European school systems work differently. Basically, kids of people  who attended given school were (and still are in many schools) preferred to be new students at this college. As you can imagine, it might create some barrier to entry for kids who are not as lucky to have parents who are alumni of this school. 

My opinion here; It is the right direction. We need more intelligent kids  from different societies to enter the schools, not making it a family  club.



### A lawyer with tech skills required

In one of my past e-mails (you can check all of them in the GitHub  archive) I wrote, that future will need lawyers with coding skills.  Turned out, the future is really nearer than we thought. It is a case  from the crypto-currencies world. Still, I picked it because such issues will be more common in the future - **[After 'Stealing' $16M, This Teen Hacker Seems Intent on Testing' Code Is Law' in the Courts](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/22/after-stealing-16m-this-teen-hacker-seems-intent-on-testing-code-is-law-in-the-courts/)**.

What do we have here? A guy read the code and found a legit way to transfer  funds within the boundaries allowed by this code. The team who wrote the code says it is theft. The guy says that it was all legit, as it was  allowed within the logic of a code. 

The court will have to judge it. I think it might be a really interesting  case, also proving my point - future lawyers will have to get to know  the code and understand it. If I spot in the future how this case has  ended, I will let you know. 

### 

### On industrialization of technology 

The mapping world often crosses with this newsletter, and here is another  case of it. LEF is a research arm of DXC which publishes interesting  work on strategies and changes in industries and technology. Here is a  new one - **[On industrialization: A Technology-driven path to the next-gen organization](https://leadingedgeforum.turtl.co/story/on-industrialization-a-technology-driven-path-to-the-next-gen-organization/)**.

It is based on the research I linked in the past, but here it is in a  well-prepared narrative story. It is recommended to read if you want to  build your opinion on the entire future of organizations and technology.

### Learning Web3 tech - 16h of a free course on YT

If you want to learn about Web3 stack, here's a good resource - **[Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contract Course â€“ Beginner to Expert Python Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ)**. It is 16h video, and it is something that makes it stand out. 

â€‹                      [ ![Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contract Course â€“ Beginner to Expert Python Tutorial](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/063ed1e8f389ce46e50b5441316bd347e1d8d8c7.png) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ)                    

### 

### And here's something on technology. 

Same as in a few recent e-mails, here are many tools/tech-related links to  resources, tools, or reports gathered in a single place. 

**[Azure Cross Tenant Access (Authentication, Authorization, Private Communication)](https://github.com/spotakash/crosstenantazure#azure-cross-tenant-access-authentication-authorization-private-communication)** is a repository with interesting architecture concepts and implementation  for cross-tenant collaboration on Azure. One of my friends asked me what the use for it is? You may not need it unless you work in a group of  companies or be part of M&A scenarios, and then it will be handy, so I put it on my bookmarks.

GitHub announced a set of new features for its Actions, among others; it is **[GitHub Actions for security and compliance](https://github.blog/2021-10-22-github-actions-for-security-compliance/)**. You may take a look at it and how to use it in your pipelines.

Speaking about GitHub, here's a real gem. I think it will be used a lot in the future - **[Use Azure AD workload identity federation to remove secrets in GitHub Actions](https://blog.identitydigest.com/azuread-federate-github-actions/)**. 

â€‹                      [ ![Use Azure AD workload identity federation to remove secrets in GitHub Actions](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/27606469dc1c0636f32a831c5307cdf0f6c2aa32.png/c4a484dd18169b7358998269e679655e8282aa0a.png) ](https://blog.identitydigest.com/azuread-federate-github-actions/)                    

In a nutshell, this feature allows creating a managed service identity on  the Azure AD side, representing a GitHub repo or action and enabling it  to access Azure resources without storing credentials in the repository. That's huge! 

To not focus on Azure alone, here's something from AWS - **[Goodbye Microsoft SQL Server, Hello Babelfish](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/goodbye-microsoft-sql-server-hello-babelfish/)**. Babelfish can now speak the MS SQL language. That will be interesting.  After dealing with Oracle, AWS now takes a shot at the core of  Microsoft's databases. Will it be goodbye for MS SQL? I don't think so,  but anyway, good to know that it is possible. 

â€‹

## Toolsspotlight

This week no completely new tools but a few updates from my side and a  couple of things I started to use or found updates in tools I'm using  anyway. 

First of all, after almost 20yrs of using only laptops, I got back to the  desktop PC. Gosh, how good it feels to have some serious power in the  computer. Laptops got better and better but have solid horsepower, which doesn't sweat even under many typical loads, and good GPU feels good.  That's the geek in me speaking. 

I've been using Windows 11 for almost two months now. Setting it up became much more manageable with **Windows Package Manager (Winget)**. Winget is not good at searching the packages (or I can't do it there in an efficient way). There are many sites providing packages discovery,  but I use **https://winget.run/** a lot right now if I need to find specific packages. 

One of the tools I install on Windows 11 (and earlier on Windows 10) is [PowerToys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/#). Windows 11 delivers much better handling of multiple screens and windows, but PowerToys with its [FancyZones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/#fancyzones) is still useful. 

In the latest release of PowerToys, a new feature is a killer feature for me - [Video Conference Mute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/video-conference-mute). Finally, I can mute/unmute my mic and camera with a single keystroke  regardless of the tool I'm using for the conference and without looking  where the heck it is in the interface. I will use it a lot. 

â€‹                      [ ![PowerToys  - Video Conferencing Mute option](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/50d08d8c7130f5134a2b119714636593d9b05146.png) ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/video-conference-mute)                    

Last change - I stopped using **[Exist](https://exist.io)**, I mentioned some time ago. 

Why? 

It is a brilliant tool to aggregate data, but besides that, it didn't  provide any interesting insights. Exist team does a decent job of  pulling all those data together and displaying it in a single interface, but for me, there wasn't much more than this in it. 

â€‹                                                                                                                                          

That's it for this week. In the end, it is a lengthy one, and I hope you have found something valuable and interesting for you.
