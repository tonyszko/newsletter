# Friday's spotlight #4

## Passion in a career, Sahil, new tool - Obsidian, books ... and more



---



Hi 

Here I come again with Friday's spotlight #5 - the week is passing fast if  you ask me. I bet the situation around us adds to it (March 2021 in  Poland still keeps us locked a bit) but let's make the best of it. 

The number of things I could put into those e-mails is huuuge! Every  Friday, I have a list full of topics. I also have conversations with  some of you (**THANK YOU**) on the e-mail threads on what interests you and how to make it move valuable for you in the future. 

My ask - if you have some thoughts about it, let me know. Reply, and let's start to talk. 
I want to keep it brief and point you to exciting threats, books, or  ideas that spark from different places. Sometimes, it might be an  article that connects with something I read before and is a reason to  write about it. 

For me, it is not a link I send to you what is important, but connections  and questions I write around them (sometimes with no answer). I hope it  is interesting for you too. 


Now let's start this week's part of it. 

​                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)                                                                                            

### Bookmarks spotlight

﻿**Do you need a passion for working?** 

I stumbled upon this piece - "[The dispassionate developer](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2021/03/22/the-dispassionate-developer/)" by Mark Seemann, shared by [Marcin Hoppe](https://marcinhoppe.com/). It aligned with my podcast episode for this week recorded a few days earlier (link at the end). 

In IT, we often hear about a passion and be passionate about what we do?  Do we need it? What if you treat it as a craft, solid but still a skill, and you are not passionate about it? Is it bad? Mark also raises a  valid point of potential abuse of passion for exploiting more work and  engagement at work. Worth reading and think about it. 

﻿***Is passion what drives you? What if it will burn down?*** 

﻿**People search but do not click - Google search analysis result**

Here is an interesting one (at least for me) - [analysis of ~5.1 trillion people click from Google shows that ~2/3rd of it (exactly 64.82%) ends with no click](https://sparktoro.com/blog/in-2020-two-thirds-of-google-searches-ended-without-a-click/). Interesting was a couple of points raised by people as a comment:

- The first result is good enough to solve the problem (a preview of the answer is good enough, I used it twice today in this way)
- Google search is often a spellchecking (guilty as charged)

The search engine is more than a search engine. On the other side, other  studies showed that ads in the search engine are not effective anymore  (brands stopped paying for ads, and nothing has changed). 

Why is it interesting? 

***In the future, those who will own our interfaces to the web - search,  voice assistants, browsers, mobile phones - will influence what we see  and how we use the web\*.**

﻿﻿ It is where the battle will go - controlling user interaction with a content of a web. 

**
The Digital division line is growing**

[
People in India get their phones locked if they miss the payment on their loan](https://restofworld.org/2021/loans-that-hijack-your-phone-are-coming-to-india/). 

Why is it important? 

﻿﻿We often forget the bubble we live in. For us, a phone or other device is a device. In some countries, getting one might be a gateway to do  business and stay connected with the rest of the world. 

Things are expensive for us, but for people in India (or other parts), it can  be frac..g costly, and they get loans. If they miss the payment - the  phone becomes a brick! Until the payment is made. 

You may say, fine! It is how it works. What is the point here is that it  creates more and more digital division in society. The previous week I  sent a link about salary disparity for developers - it is part of a  similar trend. Our community becomes divided across not only income or  geography but also digital access and capabilities. In the long run, it  impacts revenue and other elements as well. 

The other aspect of this story is how devices and access to some basics  might be broken with the corporate structure. If you want to get some  ideas behind it, follow Corey Doctorow and read his works. You can start with ["Unauthorized Bread" short](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/), which is available for free.

### Person spotlight 

Full confession, last week, I become an Angel Investor. I've invested in  Gumroad in its crowdfunding offering. Do I plan to earn a lot of money  on it? No! I did it because I like the way Gumroad is built, operated  and how they act. Few companies are showing that you can do business ,  and Gumroad is one of them. 


The person behind Gumroad is Sahil. You can follow [Sahil on his Twitter](https://twitter.com/shl) or [check his website - https://sahillavingia.com/](https://sahillavingia.com/). You will find only a handful of articles on this page, but it is worth reading them. Those I recommend are: 

- "[From Bubble to Bubble" ](https://sahillavingia.com/bubble)

- [﻿Reflecting on My Failure to Build a Billion-Dollar Company](https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting)

- [﻿No Meetings, No Deadlines, No Full-Time Employees](https://sahillavingia.com/work)

Sahil is one of those persons on the Internet I follow and observe. His  actions are turning the way we think about career, entrepreneurship, and how to do business. 

BTW - [Sahil and Gumroad are hiring](https://www.notion.so/Jobs-f43f816013b2405aa41ddefb663a4a38#a83da25afe3346eeaa5352ca10c5ea37). It might be an excellent way to start something completely different in your career.

### Tool spotlight 

I've mentioned it a couple of times - last year, I was hooked with  RoamResearch. The idea is straightforward: link every piece of  information with bi-directional links. Yet, the way it works is  fantastic (at least for me). 
I do not experiment a lot with tools if the current one works; yet, recently, I've found [Obisidian (https://obisida.md)](https://obsidian.md/). Obsidian used the same idea as RoamResearch, to take notes and link pieces of information in a graph, but:

- Using simple Markdown files as storage (easy to store, transfer, and version)

- Works on local data store (synch it through additional service or GitHub - there is a plugin for it)

- Works offline on different platforms (mobile are coming): here, I need to see how it works with online storages and  synchronization


I like the simplicity of it and the buzz around it from the community.  Obsidian has one advantage/drawback (depends on how you look at it):

- It works offline, so you need to think more about how you work with your notes 

- It has a bit different design around folders and files - you need to think about it more than RoamResearch. 


Experimenting. After using it for some time and likely blog about it. Would it be something you will be interested in?

### Books spotlight 

Related to the previous one - from Obsidian community recommendations, I picked this book: [How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WVYW33Y/)(in progress). I'm trying to become better at organizing my knowledge over  time. I'm pretty good at remembering things, but it will not last  forever. 


Based on Sebastian Gębski recommendation, I added this one to my bookshelf: [Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track](https://www.amazon.com/Staff-Engineer-Leadership-beyond-management-ebook/dp/B08RMSHYGG) (in progress). My reviews for both will follow on the GoodReads when I will finish it (two more are in progress as well :) ).

### Digital me 

As with every week, some drops from my digital real estates: 

- The blog post ["Simple decision-making framework for everyday use"](https://www.onyszko.com/simple-decision-making/): those who are with me from the beginning of this newsletter will find  it familiar. It is the blog version of one of the e-mails you got from  me. 

- [﻿New "IT i TO" podcast episode (PL)](https://link.chtbl.com/j4Bh5knK): this time, my thoughts on professional development, a need for passion  (or lack of it), and stepping out of my comfort zone (or lack of need to step out). 

​                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)                                                                                            

That's it. **

I can cram much more, but I don't want those e-mails to become a never-ending list of links and entertainment. 

I hope you've found something to follow with your coffee or tea or anything you drink or eat at the moment. 

Spring is in the air (at least in Europe).

﻿**Enjoy the weekend.**
