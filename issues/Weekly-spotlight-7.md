# Friday's spotlight #7

## Skills debt idea and how to orient yourself around it 



---



Hi 

Let's talk about the "debt" - When was the last time you thought about your skills debt? 

This week's newsletters got compressed into a single one. Suppose you were  looking for a "Friday's spotlight" here. In that case, it is with a bit  longer "Idea spotlight," which could be a separate e-mail on its own,  but I decided to put them together. Experimenting a bit :). 

If you want to get directly to links and news from this week, scroll down  to the usual section of "spotlights" at the bottom. If you're going to  explore an idea and approach of "skill debt" with me - read through it  as a whole. 

Without further delay - let's dive into this weeks' research and thinking I did for you. 



### Idea spotlight - SKILL DEBT 

How often are you borrowing money from a bank on "debt" (now more fancy and often also Defi)?

Chance is you do it not that often, and also watch debt level on your credit  card. You know it is a resource you need to take care of as you will  have to pay it off one day. 

You can assume that someone will hit a "RESET" button one day, and it will  get wiped out, and you will enjoy a free ride. Possible. Less likely,  but you can assume this scenario and rollover your debt (prolong it),  waiting for it to happen. In the event it won't happen, the consequences might be dire. 

*Have you thought about your skills in the context of "debt?"* 

*What are the skills "debt," and should you worry about it?* 

Technical teams often discuss a "technical debt." Each technical decision in the  architecture makes a piece of "technical debt." As with financial debt,  there is nothing wrong with it if created to get some value out of it  (shortcut to deliver faster), and it is paid off over time. If not, it  is lingering and collapsing one day, with the cost of servicing it  becoming heavier and heavier on us. 

Technical debt is something often covered at conferences and talks between people in tech. Skills debt is also creeping on you, but it isn't something we talk about a lot. 

Every day you are busy with daily things: doing what needs to be done, fixing what is broken, putting off the small fires started here and now in  whatever job you are doing. You optimize your time for here and now  towards "making it done" with priorities on now. 

You have set aside some time for learning and upskilling, but it is often  being dropped first when some urgency will happen. I know it first hand, and also I saw it within my team(s) over the years. 

A couple of years I had a consultant on my team; let's call him Adam. Every quarter on 1-on-1, we repeated a similar discussion:

*Adam: I want to get into the data area to change a career trajectory!* 

*Me: Sure, good idea. How can I help you?* 

*Adam: No, you can't. I have no time for it.* 

*Me: OK, let's clear some schedule for it. How about putting a day a week aside in your calendar to not get busy with a project?* 

*Adam: Nah, I tried it. It didn't work. I always have something else to do.* 

Luckily Adam decided to take a leap and lead a team in the data area, leaving  his previous skillset behind. The thing was that I could do "so much" to help him, the rest was on him, and he decided to get a little "debt" on his skill each time, for the sake of doing something "now." 

Do you recognize yourself in this pattern? 



### Situational awareness - know where you are

*(...) Building situational awareness and learning are expensive in time and  effort. Many people "optimize" those activities first to get more done  "now." (...)*

This is a quote from [Krzysztof Daniel](https://www.kda.zone/), a friend and strategy consultant who researched the "debt" in personal  skills. If you are interested in a whole discussion, it happened under  Forrest Brazeal's Twitter thread with started with a question (click an  image for a full thread): 

​                      [             ![SKill debt - twitter thread](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/7e023a4c92ba69970e2a736d2a82ea3fd81b2521.png)           ](https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal/status/1382700116587524111)                    

How do you build your "skills debt"?

There is two part of it:

- How can you build it on your own because you are not paying attention to it?
- How is it make in your organization through lack of support for fighting it?

Both happen because of a lack of attention paid to situational awareness.  You might not do a lot about the second one; you are more than well  equipped to handle the first one.

Let's talk about it. 



### Learn to recognize skills debt when you see it

You and I are similar in many ways. One of them is that we use a set of  skills we learned over time to do our job. After some time, we are  getting better and better at specific skills, and people start to value  us for it. The position comes easier in this area. It is more likely  that people will come to you with a specific type of task as you are  known to be the best for it. 

You can run on such a train for a long time, using skills you learned in the past without the need to add a new one. 

It is how you build your "skills debt." 

Doing great at daily tasks, you have missed that it exists only in a specific organization or stopped being needed because the technology has moved. 

I saw an extreme case of it in one of the banks, where I met a person who handled problems with e-mail for users. When he started, that was  something new and fancy. After 15 years, he was very good at it, He knew all the neat gritty details of it and all the tips to solve all kinds  of issues with mail clients. With the onset of services like Office 365  and Google Mail, this job ceased to exists. 

It is an extreme case, but you can recognize it in less extreme cases when you see it around you, even in your own case. 

There is another case of it of jobs and skills that exists ONLY in specific  organizations and ONLY because of how those organizations have organized their processes. You can see it often in larger companies. 

***If you see yourself doing something like it - a job which exists only in company X because of its process - RUN AWAY!*** 



### Evolution of skills 

Sam as technology, each skill has its lifetime and is a subject of  evolution. From a new and unknown to a product, done or outsource to a  tool. Suppose you are not paying attention to it. In that case, a skill  you think is still needed might already be a commodity and automated  outside of your reference frame.

Here is where "situational awareness" comes into play. You need to make an effort and ask yourself a question:

- *Are my skills up-to-date and still necessary on the market?* 
- *Are my skills needed outside of my current industry and company?*
- *Are they paying me more for it because it is required or because no new people are willing to learn it?*

Besides technical skills (or any other based on a knowledge of a subject), you  also apply them in some industry context. Let's say you are a developer  who works in a financial organization, and you know "credit scoring"  insight out. 

What might happen is that your skills are fine, but the industry you are  applying them in is going away. At the moment, you can see around you a  move to transition from "traditional" finances to "decentralized  finances." It might be a new industry that might replace traditional  finances. Will it? Time will tell, but "IF" than your "credit score"  skill might not be that valuable. It is an example where it can be seen  how the industry shift might also invalidate the value of your skill. 

Your skills exist and apply in the context of a specific industry.  Re-learning your skills is easier (it gets more challenging over time,  believe me) - people do it even late in their career. 

Finding how to apply your skillset to a new industry is more brutal. You need  to get new domain knowledge and how you can leverage your skills in it. 

The hardest part is when you find out that both your skills and domain  knowledge become obsolete. It might take a hard hit on you. 



### How to prevent it? 

How to prevent it from happening? Invest a bit of time and effort into  situational awareness. Try to step on the side and ask yourself those  questions I used before:

- ***Are my skills up-to-date and still needed on the market?\*** 
- ***Are my skills needed outside of my current industry and company?\***
- ***Are they paying me more for it because it is needed or because no new people are willing to learn it?\***
- ***Is my industry changing? How?\*** 
- ***What is the major trend in my industry which affects the way I can use my skills?\*** 
- ***What other industries are emerging which might your current environment obsolete?\***

You don't have to do it every day, but if you don't want to get surprised,  you want to invest the time to ask yourself those questions. Do it every six or twelve months. Change of such size doesn't happen overnight but  builds over time and then unfolds. 

Here's an example of someone doing it and taking action in public. Meet Nader  Dabit - a former AWS engineer I started to follow some time ago. Why  bring Nader's example? Nader has recently released a video - I Left AWS  After 3 Years - Here's the Direction I'm Headed (click in image to watch it):

​                      [             ![I Left AWS After 3 Years - Here's the Direction I'm Headed](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/3b3459f7a9738a524a7ab8ed7e8cb6fd9acc4568.png/d9fb968ffefbb53dfaa189a4a566b25dff4d479f.png)           ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyGLx2BK7pw)                    

He has an existing career. He is in the part of the market which is "hot"  now, but also he sees something on the horizon that might be the next  big thing and is on the rise. He took a leap and jumped on it. 

Do you have to quit your job in the same manner? Hell no, if you can't  afford it. You also can't afford to sit in the same place and thinking  that it will be the same for the next ten or fifteen years to come. 

It might be, but most likely, it won't. Invest a bit of your time in building your situational awareness for your  skills and industry. For that, you may want to make your kind of  "sensing machine." Here's an older blog post of mine on this subject  (click on image for a link)[.](https://www.onyszko.com/sensing-machine/).

Here come our standard Friday's spotlight bits. 

​                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)                                                                                            

### Bookmarks spotlight 

Trying to keep it short this time - once this e-mail is already somewhat a  lengthy one, second - this week was rather busy, so I had fewer  "incoming" things which are worth your time. 

**Newsletter economy**

This newsletter is free, but one of the "would-be" people who signed up to  it asked me first, "Is it a paid one?" Paid newsletters are on the rise, and in my opinion, it is a good trend, as it allows people to create  their own audience and pay for the time they do on research for it. Some of the newsletters I'm reading are really well researched. 

Here is a thread on a subject that explains the newsletter industry's ins and outs - *"How 7-Figure Newsletters Make Money"* (**[LINK](https://twitter.com/damn_ethan/status/1381969678399049730)**). Good to know how it works.



**Writing well** 

I believe writing is an important skill. I wrote about it (sic!) on my  blog - The most important skill you can learn at no cost? Here's a  handbook that isn't new, but I'm keeping getting back to it repeatedly - *Julian Shapiro's Writing well* (**[LINK](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro)**). 

Julian writes handbooks on subjects of his interests and shares them online.  Those are well researched and written. Take a look at other handbooks on his website; maybe you will find something for you. Do follow him on  Twitter and write lengthy threads once or twice a week, which are well  researched and read-worthy.

On the same subject, I can recommend you a book *"On Writing Well"* (**[LINK](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0090RVGW0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)**) - an old-timer and classic but worthy read if you want to write clearly and consistently (I'm not sure if I'm the best example of it, you tell  me :) ). 

**System's thinking in 7 images**

A while ago I wrote to you about System's Thinking. Here's a short  follow-up to this one - Systems Thinking in 7 Images - ideas are better  explained with images than words, so you may want to take a look.

The chance is you've heard about crypto and Coinbase this week. If not -  Coinbase is the biggest crypto exchange, and crypto is ... well, crypto  nowadays. Coinbase has an IPO (listing on the stock exchange) this week. Even if you are not into cryptocurrencies and stocks, it might be good  to know a bit about this new industry. Here's is an extensive write-up  on Coinbase as a company, from its establishment to IPO covering a lot - The [Paradoxes of Coinbase](https://www.readthegeneralist.com/briefing/coinbase-dpo).

It was created by researchers working together on it over the Internet,  not associated with any prominent newspaper or economy  powerhouse—creator's economy in a new dimension. 

### Tools spotlight 

This week's two tools on a little lighter note - won't change your world, but sometimes it is nice to use them.

First is a web music player, which plays tunes from YouTube (apparently) - *lofi.cafe* (**[LINK](https://lofi.cafe)**). Maybe its idea is not a breakthrough, but I really like the aesthetics  of it. I like how it looks and works, and for the last two days, it is  my go-to place to listen to, not distracting musing while at work  (listening to it at the moment). It is proof that sometimes you don't  need a breakthrough idea but good execution and iteration on something  well known. 

The second is a bit of a joke, but I think some of us will appreciate it - let me introduce you to *"The Fuck"* (**[LINK](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)**). Ever made a "typo" in a terminal command line. Guilty as charged. Now  you use the "f..." word, and it tries to fix it for you. 

​                      [             ![The Fuck example](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/73723f6f4f8da3d30f1a1e1f24029975fb726514.png)           ](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)                    

Funny, but it might let some steam off in those heated moments on the terminal. Try it. 

It was a lengthy and loaded one, so if you managed to get to this point - big THANK YOU and tap on the shoulder.

​                      [             ![Thank you with Tony Stark](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/76ed137414296f2bcbc14b9afc9b0e00e73b68bd.png)           ](https://www.onyszko.com)                    



Enjoy your weekend!
