 # Friday's spotlight #5

## Systems thinking, using ML APIs to build business, progress



---



**Hi** 

For you, it might be the last day before a bit longer weekend - in Europe,  we are entering an Easter period. Here's Friday's spotlight #6 with few  short concepts and exciting links to not stand between you and the  break. 

### Topic spotlight - Systems thinking 

If you haven't come across this term and approach, spend few minutes to  get to know what it is and later to dig a bit into this idea. It helps a lot in thinking about processes, events unfolding around us, and  personal analysis of what is happening. 

The primer of system thinking is:

- A system is a whole that contains a part. Each  part affects system properties and behaviors. System cannot be divided  into independent parts. 
- None of the parts of the system affects the  system independently. How a given piece affects the whole depends on  what other parts are doing.
- The system has properties and behaviors. Those  can not be delivered by the parts on their own and are different from  those of interest. 

Do you need an example of a system? Let's look at the car:

- It has parts (engine, breaks, gearbox, steering wheel) 
- It can transport you to other locations 
- None of the parts can do it on its own. 
- The properties of the car depend on all parts. 

I got this example from this excellent 15 minutes talk on the systems - [If Russ Ackoff had given a TED Talk...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=OqEeIG8aPPk) (don't control your screen - it is how video used to look like :) )

Systems are all around you from your architecture, through your learning process, or looking to the society around you. 

Here's a practical example of using systems thinking. Sebastian Gębski  described his point of view on the COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of systems thinking - [Applying Systems Theory to understand the pandemic](https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/applying-systems-theory-to-understand-the-pandemic/).

Here's another one: my quick draft of the outbound sales process I drafted in five minutes 

​                      ![Outbound sales process system](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/3e33515cadbb0bde3e0bdd7cf3edb905cc4d5a30.png)                    

Looking at a single picture sometimes reveals more than a week-long of lengthy meeting's 

If you want to dive a bit deeper into it, I recommend to you two resources:

- [Systems Thinking Speech by Dr. Russell Ackoff (a more extended version of the one linked above)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbLh7rZ3rhU)
- [Thinking in Systems: A Primer ](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557)- a book on the subject. 

This section took me five minutes to assemble, as I have kept my notes about it in Obsidian linked together (I wrote about Obsidian a week ago).  Linking information together and stacking the notes is a game-changer  for me. Try it.

### Bookmarks spotlight 

**New technology, new threats, and tricks** 

We entered a time where technology will force us to figure out new  solutions to problems and threats posed by industrialized technology  components available for everyone. Here's one example - Pair accused of  turning photos into vids to crack the tax dept facial recognition system in China.

Machine learning makes face recognition easier to implement to verify our  identity online. In the same way, it makes it easier for people who want to crack the system ... to break the system. In this case, turn the  picture into a live video to fool the ML safeguarding tax system. It is  not a doomsday scenario, but I expect a lot of fun and creativity from  the digital crime scene powered by AI. 



**Use components to build a system.** 

Here's how ready components makes and will continue to make building business easier. [An excellent example in a Twitter thread is building and selling AI copy-writing tools in a yea](https://twitter.com/dannypostmaa/status/1376918885807480835)r. 

​                      [             ![How Headlime was built on top of AI](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/0c735e15c927b01630d2b9add6546ba741cc8363.png)           ](https://twitter.com/dannypostmaa/status/1376918885807480835)                    

The Headline was built:

- Within a year 
- On-top of OpenAI APIs 
- By a guy who learned to code in the last two years 
- Become profitable in 8 months 
- Sold for $1M to other similar company after 12 months 

Not a bad ROI possible only because it used an industrialized ML model  exposed through APIs. My prediction - we will see more and more of such  stories in the future.

BTW - I tried this tool and it works pretty well. This e-mail is still  crafted by hand, but I can see such tools being used more and more in  the future. And if you need to write some engaging e-mail or subject -  give it a try. 



Building business, especially online, is not always all rosy. Here is a different example. This is a story: [How I lost $10,000,000 by doing something stupid.](https://twitter.com/awilkinson/status/1376985854229504007)

​                      [             ![How I lost $10,000,000 by doing something stupid.](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/70b7f03f9477bca9b1e53980f31d47152468550c.png)           ](https://twitter.com/awilkinson/status/1376985854229504007)                    

It isn't a story about money alone also presents how we, as humans (yes,  you too), have a problem with the acceptance of sunk cost.

### Inspiration spotlight

First disclaimer - it is not about promoting my content, and I didn't plan it for today but decided to included it. Here are two pieces of video. 

- [A video that took 4hrs to record to get 6 minutes of, let's say, mediocre performance](https://t.co/2SFUJoB78A). 
- [A video took 45m to record to produce 20 minutes of, say, a bit better performance](https://t.co/oqAeQYfLwZ). 

What is the difference?

**FOUR years!** 

It came out and hit me when I reviewed a presentation for a conference for one of our consultants. He was bothered by the time it took him to  prepare a 20mintues video. 

Whatever you are doing, it is for a long-haul; the only way to master it is: 

- to do it, 
- do repetitions, and 
- get better. . 

If you don't enjoy doing it - STOP! Find something else and repeat

That's almost  all this week. It was a bit intensive as you got another e-mail from me earlier this week. 



Before the final "cheers," let's play a game. Assume COVID is gone, and we meet in person:
