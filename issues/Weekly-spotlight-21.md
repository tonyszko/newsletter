# Weekly Spotlight #21

## Breaking out of reference bubble, cracks in technology stagnation, AR/VR is progressing, weekly bunch of books and tools and more



---



Hi 



Good to see you again in this Weekly Spotlight. Before getting to the  resources and links I picked for you this week, I want to delve a bit  into something I already wrote. Still, what got back to me recently, and I started working on it on my own. 



### Breaking through our 'frame of reference bubble'! 

What is (might be) the biggest challenge for you and me in our thinking? **Getting out of our experience and thought bubble**. 

I've recently observed a lot of thinking about solutions to the problems,  which exists only in specific settings and environments and, based on  it, making an assumption that the answer is needed. Because people who  do it are vocal or backed by a lot of capital. Their approach to the  problem gets motion, even if there's no need for it from another  environmental point of view or it was already solved. 

So, I observe that my current thinking about it results from my experience  bubble because of my info-bubble and environment. I don't see other  people outside of it where the problem might still exist.

**Bottom line: Be aware of the experience and thought bubble and take deliberate steps to confront your thinking with others. For small things in daily  life, in your professional life, and in business. You will not rule it  out completely, but it will help you better judge things.**

Nowadays (2021), it is hard not to take a step and not hear about crypto as a  technology and financial instrument. As for every new thing, people try  to apply it to different problems and areas. Some of them make sense,  and some of them not - or at least not from my bubble perspective. 

If I hear that we need crypto to solve problems with the current banking  system for money transfer because it is slow, expensive, and not  accessible to people, I have my doubts. I use daily a system that is  accessible (mobile phone), fast and inexpensive (direct transfers to  people, free transfers within the country, reasonable fees, and time for international transfers). 

Believe it or not, I can go to ATM with my mobile phone and withdraw cash with  no use of my card or fee. Same with paying for goods to another person  with a phone and account or money transfer. A value proposition of doing the same with crypto with a low fee of a few % is an outrageous thing. 

And BTW, in Africa, they solved it a long time ago with M-Pessa: a system  based on mobile phones and optimized for low tech and low bandwidth  environment and everyday use by ordinary people. 

Yet, people work on solutions to tackle, which is my reality often was  already attacked. Why? Because their banking system is stuck somewhere  in the past and does not offer such possibilities. 

It doesn't mean that those problems do not need to be solved. There are no people in other places in the world who will not benefit from it. Our  world's capital weight and technology focus make solutions more oriented around the situation of few countries. People in the tech industry,  backed by capital, work to solve problems seen from their bubble. Where  such issues might not exist or are already solved in other places. 

Instead of the next technological solution, what might be needed is to look at  why this problem does not exist in other places and if it can be applied here as well. 

The risk of being in your own experience bubble is also present in daily  work and life. This article might be the best example of it as I write  it based on:

- My environment and country where I'm living 
- Information I acquired from my info- and social- bubbles 
- My life and world experience so far are limited to places I've been and people I've met. 
- My professional environment and what I do in it.

You might assume that people are doing something wrong based on your  experience, but you don't know why they are doing it in this way or what environment shaped it. 

Yes, it might be a lack of knowledge or insights from other places, but  there might also be a good reason why they do it in this specific way.  It might be their culture, local regulations, limitations of their work  or life environment which cause them to do it in a particular way. 

If you want to be better at whatever you are doing, do not assume that  your point of view is correct. Be aware of your experience and  information bubble. 

Ask yourself: what I don't know about the specific problem or the way  things are being done, which is outside of my frame of reference and how you can expand your understanding of it. 

The last thing never was easier than now with:

- Books and accessibility to it
- Information and experiences transferred by people through media: posts, tweets, YouTube videos 
- People and their accessibility - you are one tweet or call away from almost every person on a planet. 

We need more challenging of our way of thinking and looking outside of our frame of reference. Staying in it is comfortable but will only  reinforce our beliefs and point of view on the world around us. 

I leave it for you as food for thought. Don't limit it to the technology; I used it as an example. In general, the more you work, the more you  know in your field, the harder it gets to break through your information bubble.

Now let's jump to Weekly Spotlight from what I read, found, or learned this week. 



### Bookmark's spotlight

**Seeing cracks in great stagnation?** 

Technology around you is getting better and better and changing fast? Are you sure about it? What might look like a fast-changing environment is  considered as stagnation by many and by numbers. There are fewer  breakthroughs; what you see are iterations around previous inventions  and innovations. Technology development around us is slowing down for a  while; now, we are starting to catch up again. 

As pointed out in [Cracks in the great stagnation](https://www.agglomerations.tech/cracks-in-the-great-stagnation/) article by Caleb Watney, there are signs of new discoveries and  technologies. Think about it - what you see is more compute power.  Compute power is based on chips and concepts dating back decades right  now. When last time we had a breakthrough on the scale of micro-chip? 

With new developments pushing people to space again (Mars, Moon), move to  electrification and biotechnology, see us getting up to speed again. 



**AR/VR and case of LIDAR and evolution of components** 

One potential area of development mentioned in the text linked earlier is  AR/VR. I agree; I wrote on a subject at the beginning of pandemic in [Events and conferences goes VR!](https://www.onyszko.com/events-and-conferences-goes-vr/) blog post. 

As I mentioned on another occasion, we need some other vendors than  Facebook to step into this game. Still, today I want to link for you an  example of how this technology has developed. Here's a video showing the Azure Remote Rendering service usage on HoloLens 2 to visualize a  building 3D scan based on over 1 billion points ([LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2k9Jdm7CuU)). 

â€‹                      [ ![1 billion points via Spot robot visualized in AR with HoloLens 2](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/2947/2947243/images/293ffde097d39eb484c3318f81baf557e2a813d9.jpeg) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2k9Jdm7CuU)                    

What is interesting is that this scan was done with Lidar and using the Spot robot. Why is it interesting? Here again, I will call out Wardley's  Maps evolution patterns - all of it was done with products available.  Not the cheapest one, but all are products and services. They will get  more affordable, and on top of them, a new industry and occupations will form. 

A great example of component's evolution and how they will form new  services and use them around them. BTW - every user of the new iPhone  and iPad has a Lidar at their disposal (some Android phones as well). 



**Hell froze over too many times - you can run Microsoft's Linux distribution on your own now.**

It stopped to surprise anyone that Microsoft is using Open Source, but hey - getting to the point that [they have their own Linux distro](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-released-cbl-mariner-linux-distro) and put it in public is a last point on the journey. It is technical  news, and it will not change your life, but I decided to link it here  anyway because:

- It is an excellent point on how a change of  strategy for a company might turn its faith for better or ... for worse. You can observe now which companies are stuck in the past and trying to 
- It is a great point to prove the beginning of  this e-mail - doing this required someone at Microsoft to ask "what we  got wrong and others right" questions. 

A person who did it was definitely not a Steve Ballmer. It isn't an  accident that he is on a picture illustrating this information. 



### Tool's spotlight 

This time I will point out two tools I started to use in my social media. 

[Typefully ](https://typefully.app/)allows you to write Twitter threads and post them. The free version allows  that; paid version adds features to it and also provides better Twitter  analytics. I use the free version so far. Typefully is an excellent  example of a simple idea executed well and how specialized tools are  better at doing single things than swiss army knives. It is also an  example of how you can focus on those tools for specific tasks. Its  authors also created a [MailBrew](https://mailbrew.com/) - an app to digest your social feeds to single (or multiple) e-mails. 

Focus and design make all the difference in this case. 

The other tool (so there will be more than two :) ) is a [Bio.Link](https://bio.link/). Some time ago, someone asked me if he can buy me a coffee, and I set up a profile on [the Buy me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tonyszko/) site. It was another example of the evolution of products. I did it in less than 15 minutes with payments and everything.

Now authors of Buy me a Coffee created a simple way to put all your links  in the simple form on Bio.Link. I know there are plenty of such tools,  but if you want to gather all your digital assets in a single place,  this looks nice. I gave it a try; take a look; you will like it as well. 

â€‹                                                                                                                                          



### Book's spotlight 

I'm still going through "[Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945](https://www.amazon.com/Postwar-History-Europe-Since-1945/dp/B004IDNQOW/)" - fascinated by long history read. It will take me a while. If you want something shorter with a historical concept, take a look at [The Bomber Mafia: A Dream, a Temptation, and The Longest Night of the Second World War](https://www.amazon.com/Bomber-Mafia-Temptation-Longest-Second/dp/B091J2CP5X/) - I listened to it recently through Audible, and it is a great book to  hear and probably to read as well (in the audio version it is a  well-directed show). The Bomber Mafia is a book about the history of  bombing the air force and the persistence of ideas and convictions.  There is a twist from it you can apply to modern times and other areas. 

There are two new books in my queue for your inspiration:

- [Monotasking: How to Focus Your Mind, Be More Productive, and Improve Your Brain Health](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Monotasking-Focus-Productive-Improve-Health/dp/1631585487)
- [Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective](https://www.amazon.com/Why-Greatness-Cannot-Planned-Objective-ebook/dp/B00X57B4JG/r)

Those are in the queue, so I don't have an opinion on them so far, but you  will pick it up for a summery time. My opinions, as always, will land on my [profile on GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39490736-tomasz-onyszko).

â€‹                                                                                                                                          



That's all for this week. I hope you enjoy summer weather or summer holidays  if you are in the Northern hemisphere at the moment. I'm back to the  work and projects in full swing but charged after a bit of a break and  high intensity of physical exercises with low news intake :). 



Have a great weekend, friends.
