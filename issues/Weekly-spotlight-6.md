# Friday's spotlight #6 

## Digital nations, paid search services, books ... and more



---



Hi



Another week fly's by. Here it is - another Friday's Spotlight with a pack of  thoughts, resources, and information I processed this week. 

For those who are new to the list (yay, thank you for signing up) - this is a weekly, short e-mail with quick subjects, thoughts, and resources.  Every two weeks, you will get a bit longer form on a specific topic. It  is how it works on this e-mail list. 

Before I jump into the content - üôèüôè **thank you for all the feedback** üôèüôè. 

I appreciate it, I read every bit of it, and as some of you know, it  sometimes ends in a lengthy e-mail thread over some concepts and ideas.  I'm exploring the option to bring those discussions into a more  organized form available for everyone (kind of discussion club on Slack  or Circle) - have not decided about this one. What do you think? Would  you find it interesting? 

E-mail is an old communication method but still is the one with the most  intimate and private touch and IMO most asynchronous one. It definitely  has its advantages. One of the most exciting things, which happened last year, is that Basecamp (remember I told you about DHH) [managed to build an e-mail service HEY, paid 99$ a year.](https://hey.com/) Thousands of people flocked to it with their wallets. 

Are we becoming tired of all those free services digesting our data? . I have something on it in Bookmark's spotlight as well. 

Now let's jump into what I have prepared for you this week. Friday's  spotlight #7 (magical number in some cultures) ... here it comes. 



‚Äã                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)                                                                                            

### **Idea Spotlight:** Will we live in digital nations? 

From time to time, I throw on you an idea I'm exploring, and I haven't  decided if it will happen. Still, it is definitely an area with a lot of creativity. Many of those ideas happen in the community around crypto  nowadays (it won't be about Bitcoin or other coins - I promise you!). 

Why?

It has gathered many people with creative thinking wondering on "what if"  scenarios and "can we do it because it doesn't seem to work already."  What I like about it - they are experimenting. 

Last week during my running sessions, I listened to [Tim Ferris's podcast](https://tim.blog/2021/03/24/balaji-srinivasan/) with Balaji Srinivasan ([website](https://balajis.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/balajis)) - I didn't know Balaji before. He throws many brilliant and provocative ideas about how the world might turn in the future.

Balaji's project is [1729.com](https://1729.com/) ([here's an article about the genesis of the name](https://www.ndtv.com/education/national-mathematics-day-2019-hardy-ramanujan-number-2152767)).

What a brilliant idea if you can afford to build it. In a nutshell:

- Create a task that lets people develop some skill or master some task.
- Ask them to document it for others. 
- Put a reward with $$$ (or BTC) for the best result. 

It allows people to learn new skills one skill at a time, earn some income - let's say $100. In some countries, it is a lot. At the same time, it  builds an open-source learning resource for other people to explore. 

A simple idea, simple execution with potential for a big upside for many people 

What crypto plays in this concept? It removes a barrier to enter and/or earn (transfer, bank account) for participants. It allows people from  underdeveloped places to take part in it. What is needed is access to  the Internet (we take it for granted, but it is not).

What connects it with digital nations? 

This week's assignment on 1792.com has the title "[How to Start a New Country](https://1729.com/how-to-start-a-new-country/)"? If not practical, it is an interesting thought exercise. 

How do you think it might happen? Will it happen? How will it look like? I  have my doubts and questions about it. I'm closer to put it in writing  as a list of open questions and fill with answers over time. 

BTW - the digital nation already exists here in Europe. You can become an  Estonia e-resident as simple as it can be through a web page. Try it. 

To put some ideas into your mind, here are two books which are exploring subjects around it:

- I[nfomocracy: Book One of the Centennial Cycle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0151U75ME/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title). It is a Sci-Fi book that explores a future with self-organized  micronations, with direct democracy based on the system with equal  access to information.

- [The Sovereign Individual: Mastering the Transition to the Information Age](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AK9IXXM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) - is 14 years old book exploring possible changes that digital  technology will bring to the relationship between people and nations  (warning: it is very one-sided, highlighting only benefits, not  discussing potential problems).



That's the idea that caught my brain cycles this week :).  Let's look at some things to read and listen to. 



‚Äã                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)

**Standing out and your voice in engineering culture.** 

My PoV (Point of View for those who don't know this acronym) - everyone in engineering should have a voice. Voice doesn't mean that you are a  seasoned public speaker or pick the crowd with your charisma. Voice  means you have an opinion; you can express it. You can also develop it  for public appearance. 

Here is worth reading an article on the subject "[The Engineering Leader's Guide to Crafting a Personal Brand that Stands Out From the Crowd](https://review.firstround.com/the-engineering-leader's-guide-to-crafting-a-personal-brand-that-stands-out-from-the-crowd)." As a sneak peek, here are headlines from this article: 

- MYTH #1: PERSONAL BRANDING IS DISTINCT FROM YOUR DAY JOB. 
- MYTH #2: THE BEST SPEAKERS ARE MASTERS OF SEVERAL DOMAINS. 
- MYTH #3: GREAT SPEAKERS ARE EFFORTLESS. 
- WRAPPING UP: HOW TO BAKE PERSONAL BRANDING INTO THE COMPANY CULTURE. 

Think what the best way for you to build your voice and brand with it, start  doing it today is. It doesn't have to be something big. 



**NFTs explained** 

I know it was covered here before, but last week I had some discussions  online around NFTs. I found out that people think this technology solves issues and has properties, which it doesn't crack and doesn't have.  Here are two solid materials on a subject to explain what it is and does at a current stage: 

- [Demystifying NFTs (a Twitter thread by Naval)](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1378954767863443461) - Naval (also introduced before in this newsletter) explains what NFT  is, does, and the future potential. Short-form but very solid.
- NFTs Weren't Supposed to End Like This - an  article from the person behind the original idea of NFTs covering how it started and what it does. 

BTW - I encourage you to [sign-up for Naval's newsletter.](https://nav.al/) It is brilliant, and it covers a lot but not only technology. 



**Awesome Leadership and Management** 

There is a bunch of AWESOME GitHub Repos - a curated list of knowledge on a  specific subject. I have many of them in my GitHub bookmarks (do you  think my GitHub repo list might be interesting for you?), and I've  recently added this one - ["Awesome Leadership and Management.](https://github.com/LappleApple/awesome-leading-and-managing)" 

Not a code but a list of references to books and readings on the different  subjects from culture, through CTO role, VP of Engineering, Influencing  others to plan roadmaps and processing. 

No, I haven't read all of it :). I keep it handy to check when in need of something to read on such subjects.



**Would you pay for the search?** 

I promised something around the change of our expectations and habits in how we use Internet services. Here it is. 

Would you pay for a search engine if it would not track you? 

Google made a search part of the Internet. The price of it is that they track  you to sell you ads. Is there another way? If people pay for HEY e-mail  when Gmail is free, would they pay for the search?  [Neeva is a startup on track to test this idea](https://neeva.com/). I signed up for the waitlist to try it. 

For now, if you want to try a different search with privacy, [there is still DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/). Try it. 



‚Äã                                                                                                    ![img](https://cdn.mailerlite.com/images/default/spacer.gif)                                                                                            

### Books spotlight 

Here's one added to my list this week - ["Helgoland: Making Sense of the Quantum Revolution.](https://www.amazon.com/Helgoland-Making-Sense-Quantum-Revolution-ebook/dp/B08LR73RTL/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3ET7A9OLR01AF&dchild=1&keywords=helgoland+carlo+rovelli&qid=1617476529&sprefix=Helgoland%2Caps%2C257&sr=8-1)" Sometimes this whole Internet sucks, like now - friends in Europe enjoy it, and I got brilliant reviews. Still, I can't get it as my Amazon  account is registered in the US (long story). I have to wait until May. 

Anyway, looks like a good read for the May long weekend if you want to pick  something around physics and its laws. I definitely will read it. 



That's all, folks. I hope you will find something for you for the upcoming  week.  The world around us is opening up a bit (unfortunately not in  Poland, at least not yet). 



Stay positive, enjoy your time.
