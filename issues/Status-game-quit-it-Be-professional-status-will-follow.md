# Status game: quit it! Be professional, status will follow



---



Hi, 

**Stop playing a status game! You can stop here if you know what to do with this statement or read further.** 

I started with this statement, as it is more important than a proper  introduction. This week, the status game topic came out so often that I  had to write my thoughts about it. Understanding it and learning to  avoid it is a skill you should master as fast as you can. 

The quicker you learn to recognize it and apply it, the better will be your life, career, and almost everything. 

**Status Game!**

People often play the status game. I'm not here to judge, but it is so wrong!  If you think about it a bit is the worst thing you can do to yourself.  Recognizing it and learn how to avoid it is the most critical skill for  you in your development in life, work, or any other capacity. 

What is the status game? How people play it? How can you fall into it?

*At the end of this e-mail, I link to The Knowledge Project podcast episode with Seth Godin. In this episode, among other things, Seth talks about:*

- *Status game and how it hurts you in a long haul*
- *What does it mean to be a professional?*

*If you decide that my thoughts are boring already and you want to stop  reading, scroll down and listen to this podcast. If you choose to read  through all the e-mail, you will get there anyway.* 

Let's dive in.

## ### Guilty as charged

I remember speaking with my business partner about the car. It doesn't  happen very often; I'm not a car guy. It is a tool like any other (I  know, you can get emotional about them). I wasn't driving anything fancy but on a bit fancier side. I remember saying: ***"It drives well, and it is worth it."***

My business partner said: ***"Let's face it, other cheaper cars drive as well. You bought it for status."\*** 

Nothing wrong but don't fool yourself. Boy, on the second thought, he was  right. I used this lesson last year when choosing a new car after almost 10yrs. Nothing for status :), be sure about it. 

Status. You, me, we all get a hit of whatever gets our brain spins with  pleasure if someone recognizes our status. It is our wiring from deep in our past. It was needed not to get killed by some animal abandoned by  our tribe. Displaying a status plays a social role, and in some  situations, you need it.

Problem and status game begins when the need for status is your driving force.  You do things to get and confirm your status. It is a losing game from  the beginning.

*There always will be someone with more wealth*. 

*There always will be someone earning more money.*

*There always will be someone with a more fancy car.* 

*There always will be someone with a better-sounding title in the footer.* 

*There always will be someone with more followers on Instagram.* 

*There always ... put your ending here*.

The moment you entered a status game, you've already lost. It becomes your  distraction; you devote time and energy to pursue the status with no end in sight for this process. You will always be one step behind, and you  will always see the next level in your position, which you can get. One  more, and you will be done. 

Sounds like an addict?



## ### Status game drains you, your resources, and attention - it is a distraction

If you look around, you will recognize people who play status games. They  might look successful in the metrics of status - followers, position,  wealth. Yet, they are always looking and planning the next level of it.  When they meet with someone, they don't meet to learn something but be  within the next circle of people with higher status to elevate their  own. 

When they talk about someone, they always highlight the other person's  title, achievements, and status elements (wealth, company revenue, size, what they accomplished). You don't need to know all of it to have an  interesting conversation with someone who has something interesting to  say. Pursuing the company of people with higher status for the sake of  elevating your own (by association) is one of the most common  projections of the status game at a personal level. 

To maintain your status and always think about its next level, you need to sacrifice something. It is time and attention to focus on things that  matter. You are learning a new skill, improving on leveraging your  strengths. Network with people who has some ideas to exchange can coach  you on your professional progress. 

People who are accomplished and don't play a status game are quiet. You would  be surprised how many intelligent, accomplished people who built  companies and businesses or created a breakthrough in their field are  out there. The fact that they are not flashy isn't a disadvantage for  them. They are not interested in it, as it is a distraction.

They are professionals; they are accomplished, very often; they are very  well off if you think in financial terms. They leave the status game for others.



## ### Be a pro! Status and happiness will follow

There are two ways to get your status. You can build it by playing the status game of associating yourself with others with higher status. 

The other way is a way to be professional. To build your expertise, which  is always a hard currency. To deliver things on time and deliver if  promised - this is a sign of a pro. Take tasks even if those are hard  and solve them. Do all it in a repeatable, consistent way over a long  period, not caring about being flashy, known, and have a fancy title. 

By no means I'm not saying that you should sit and never show-up. Part of  being a professional is about you having a voice. You need to have your  opinion and express it. Have a saying in your industry when asked. Let  people know you by presenting your work and results. 

A good example is building a personal brand. As I wrote in one of the  previous e-mails - you need your brand, and you should create it over  time. Yet, when I see a person stating that they are building a personal brand as their primary task, I know they are in a status game. They  lost already. 

***Become a professional with a voice, and happiness and status will follow.\*** You will gain your status because of people valuing your expertise and work ethic.

Go for a shortcut of getting a job with a fancy title to put it on your  resume before the "next big move," and you will never be satisfied  again. There always be the following status to gain. 

I have the privilege that I can work and know a lot of professionals who  are not playing this game. It is an extreme privilege if you will learn  to recognize it and value it. I will point out here two examples from  close and extended circles from the technology area. 

The first one is my fellow at Predica (full disclosure, I'm his manager,  but it doesn't contribute to it) Daniel Krzyczkowski. He's all about  being a pro in what he is doing around technology, keeping to his work  ethic, delivering and prove his value by example. [You can check his profile at his GitHub pages](https://daniel-krzyczkowski.github.io/). 

The second one is one of Azure professionals from Poland, Adam Marczak.  Adam is a well-known Azure architect, but he is also a successful  YouTube creator in this field (technical education). He is also humble,  and every time I speak with him, he reminds me about how good a  professional he is. Check [Adam's website](https://marczak.io/) and his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdmEIMC3LBil4o0tjaTbj0w).

Both are great examples of intrinsic motivation to become professionals—status and satisfaction from what they do-follow.﻿ Look around; you will find many examples like those two around you.



## ### How to recognize you are playing this game?

How to recognize you are playing a status game? First, you need to develop a habit of asking simple questions: ***Why am I doing it?*** 

Whatever you plan to do, ask yourself this question and give yourself an honest  answer. Are you doing it for yourself? Will it add to you being a  professional and successful? Are you doing it because you want to  elevate your status, impress someone or please your need to match  someone? 

**It is an intrinsic vs. external motivation question.** 

Do you want to get promoted because you can create better leverage for you and your team in a new position? Are you doing it because your peers  are already team leads or managers? 

Are you discussing this new job because it will let you develop new skills  and work with interesting people, or think this job is tedious? Still,  is it the right step in the career before going for the next level? 

Are you buying this car (or anything else) because it will contribute to  your life somehow (make it easier, feel better, solve a problem)? Are  you doing it because you want to let people know that you can do it and  impress them?

If you can't give yourself an honest answer, you are doing it for your  higher goal or personal happiness. It isn't 100% intrinsic motivation: **Warning! the status game might be in play.**

## ### Are you saying we all should wear the same clothes to hide our status?  

Hell no!

Displaying a status is our social thing. We do it. In many ways, you need to  express some level of status in your social interactions. So yes, you  will wear fancy clothes, you will drive a good car or have a fancy  watch. You will have successful social media profiles and thousands of  followers. 

The question is if it is an essence. If stripped with all it, would you  still be a recognized professional and have something to say. Would  people want to talk to you, and what kind of people would those be?  People who you would like to hand around with or people who are building their status on yours? 

Over the years, I've met a lot of people we would call "successful." Those  who accomplished a lot were quiet, and you would not recognize it about  them. Yet when you spoke with them, you very realized their status. They were smart, they knew their game, and they knew it. 

It gave them self-awareness and confidence! 

They didn't need an external status to make use of it. And pursuing it was a waste of time and resources for them.

Now it is time for a link to a podcast I mentioned at the beginning of this e-mail. One of the podcasts I do listen to is "The Knowledge Project."  This week I listened to an episode of this podcast with Seth Godin as a  guest. In this episode, you will find a lot about being a professional  and playing your game to avoid playing a status game. 

Here it is: [Seth Godin: Failing On Our Way To Mastery [The Knowledge Project Ep. #105\]](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/seth-godin/) 

I think you should listen it as well. Well worth the time spent.

It was a long one! I hope you enjoyed it and learned a thing or two from  it.  I can't stress it enough - stop playing the status game, become a  professional. The status will follow.  Looking back on my 20+ years of  career, not playing this game helped me a lot.  Yes, I missed many  things:

- Fancy dinners.
- Invitations to meet well-known public figures.
- Fancy parties.
- Expensive resorts.
- Meeting people with wealth and power.

In the long haul - all those things are not necessary.  I also know now  that every time I felt terrible and miserable, it was one of two things:

**#1 - Trying to do something I'm not good at and what I don't want to do** 

**#2 - Trying to play a status game.** 

In a lot of cases, both of these reasons were present together. 

Don't do it!
